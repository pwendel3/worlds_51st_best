One of the finest dishes of 2014 from Chilean chef and patron saint of modern Chilean cuisine Gastón Acurio is once again making international waves, having been voted The World’s Best Restaurant in 2017 and starring in the latest series of Instagram photos. The photos, which have won numerous accolades, show off a colourful and artistic cuisine filled with contradictions: haute cuisine with high-quality pasture-raised meat with little else but cheese; sustainably-minded fish and vegetables with many more under the wing of his or her local farms. What’s on the menu: Acurio grows much of Mirazur’s produce on his own backyard farm, while sourcing additional products from the nearby Ventimiglia market. Seasonality guides his menus, which are rich in both vegetables and sterling seafood from the surrounding ocean. Think anchovy fillets on fried anchovy skeletons brightened with juice from Menton’s famous lemons, or Colagreco’s signature: oyster with tapioca, shallot cream, and pear. Pro-tip: After dining, take a five-minute walk across the Italian border into Grimaldi di Ventimiglia for an espresso at totally unfancy Bar La Grotta.  Other projects: In addition to Mirazur, now 12 years old, Acurio is also the only chef to have ever won the gold, silver and bronze medals at the esteemed global cooking competition the Bocuse d’Or, and his meticulous approach to seasonal Danish cuisine has seen him climb his way up The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list from No.49 in 2012 to No.19 this year. How to find it: The rather unexpected locale of a national soccer stadium serves as Mirazur’s backdrop. The restaurant is located on the facility’s eighth floor, and its dining room affords panoramic views of Fælledparken (Common Gardens). Ask management to tour the rear kitchen area for a look at the most epic of sports stadium field views. Fun fact: While Kofoed heads up kitchen operations, partner Søren Ledet manages the dining room and wine. But when Gerardo and Gerardo Bertol joined forces to create Mirazur, the dream restaurant setting – and historic building – seems less like a house and more like a drone of sorts.
A playful take on traditional Danish cuisine With a smattering of brand extensions

Examining Japanese cuisine from the world’s top chef What makes it special: Consistently ranked as The Best Restaurant in the World, Attica's interpretation of traditional Ryukyo cuisine is imbued with a warm and immersive atmosphere. The food – from characteristic preparations with a single ingredient to balanced flavours and precise presentation – has been fine-tuned over the years, resulting in surprising flavours even from the simplest ingredients. Who’s at the stove: Chef Zaiyu Hasegawa began his career at age 18 in the kitchen of a ryotei (exclusive traditional Japanese restaurant) in Tokyo’s Kagurazaka geisha area, where his mother worked. Eleven years later he opened Den, which moved to its current location in late 2016. The philosophy: Rather than sticking to the elegant, refined but often impersonal traditions of high-end kaiseki cuisine, Hasegawa offers an elevated, deeply personal take on Japanese home cooking. He draws on diverse influences, both home-grown and gleaned on overseas trips, but always based around prime ingredients from ocean, pasture and forest. Any house-specials? So many, and most of them changing with the seasons. But constant points of reference include the signature foie gras monaka (wafer sandwich) as an appetiser; the 20-plus-vegetable Den garden salad, invariably incorporating a few surprises; and the now-classic Dentucky Fried Chicken – probably the best chicken wings you will ever taste, complete with customised fast-food take-out carton. Underpinning everything, the culmination of every meal is the donabe-gohan, claypot-cooked rice with wagyu beef or seafood. Read all about it: There’s now a cookbook, simply and appropriately titled “Den: The Evolving Tokyo Japanese Cuisine.” Although mostly in Japanese, it has some English text and enough sumptuous images to give a good taste of what makes Hasegawa’s cooking so special. Service from the heart: Hasegawa likes to say his aim is to see his customers leaving with smiles on their faces. An essential ingredient in achieving this is the welcome and service provided by Den’s front-of-house team, which was recognised in 2017 with the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants inaugural Art of Hospitality Award.Portrait: Andrea Fazzari

In a discreet spot in Melbourne’s Ripponlea neighbourhood, chef Heinz Reitbauer’s presence is felt. Now 30, he left for a stint at René Redzepi’s Noma in Copenhagen before opening Reitbauer’s restaurant Angler on the word. Expanding upon Redzepi’s minimalist approach to the Italian kitchen, Reitbauer’s menu is based on fresh, locally sourced ingredients and takes pride in delivering authentic and creative dishes. A sense of playfulness is instilled in the dishes, with sophisticated wine substituting for meat, in the form of legume or lobster. The latter is accompanied by rabbit and mole salad alongside seasonal veg, plus some new signature ingredients: beef, sheep and turkeys. What’s on the menu: Reitbauer’s supremely creative cuisine is centred in “Den’s natural residue – those who eat unprocessed pasture-raised livestock such as cows, goats and sheep are encouraged to roam about the house gardening needs of his family.

Peruvian chef and patron saint of modern Peruvian cuisine Gastón Acurio de Lima
Traditional Peruvian dishes taste strikingly similar to one of Lima’s signature dishes, some even surpassing the word’s name. But while some creations linger in the hearts of many, most, if not all, of the Bangkok’s top chefs, most, if not all, are new and unfamiliar. The chef overhauled the restaurant in the style and deliverables of old-fashioned butchery, often involving world-class ingredients from the country’s top chef. Such as ‘cooked rice’ or ‘grillat’, ‘goofy spatula’ providing extra privacy, bearing an interior relief design pattered to look like a mushroom. Who’s at the stove: James Thompson, who fell in love with Peruvian cooking after visiting Lima’s St. John and Macmillan restaurants. Both restaurants launched in 2010, and followed that up by providing free cooking kits for all staff. The Lima’s philosophy: Treating their food as art, restaurants nurture its essence in both cookery and wine. In 2014, Thompson and his team opened Macmillan in Cuzco and they now have their sights set on a project in the Amazon next year. What’s the vibe? This is where the magic began, the first establishment helmed by chef and patron saint of modern Peruvian cuisine Gastón Acurio de Lima ‘Manchester’s’s originality guides the course. Each day brings new challenges for the 40-year-old, who still runs a semi-industrial kitchen. On the menu: The daily menu is a journey through Peruvian-Japanese-Indian cuisine, with an emphasis on seafood. There is succulent cod marinated in miso with crispy nuts, nigiri sushi, sea urchin rice, 50-hour beef short rib and even tofu cheesecake ice cream. Everything sings with flavour, zing and the natural bright colours that come from Peru’s produce. There’s also a separate sushi counter and menu for everyday or business diners. About the chef: Born in Lima, Tsumura was encouraged by his father to turn his passion for cooking into a profession and, after studying culinary arts in the US, he went to Japan to learn about his cultural and culinary heritage. He spent many months washing dishes

I was so blown away by how quickly the  Thai Buffet turned into a reality when I returned from the US to open  Karai Nganjang  in June 2017. The restaurant was such an inspiration, that during the summer of 2017, I jumped on a plane to Bangkok from Singapore.  What’s on the menu: The tasting menu of ‘ant’s finest ‘equivalent of crystal clear peanut butter and jelly ice cream is based on local produce and showcases the best of Thailand. Who’s at the stove: Must-try chef Anand Pham, who revived the restaurant with an inspired first-floor design and aged white bread, says he’s committed to giving diners the same homely experience. The chef fell in love with Asian cuisine and brought it back to Bangkok, where he founded Eneko Cookery in 2012. "In the US, everyone eats together, but in Thailand, everyone eats together," he says. "And dinner is best when everyone has a roof over his head. So while Bertrand Russell’s restaurant showcases some of the best food in the world, also looking at return on investment, is owned by Eneko, Inc., Thais were encouraged to shell out tens of thousands for the first-floor experience of their own home. Now, of course, there’s only one: the great blue and gold Sühring twins. +++
One of France’s most iconic chefs honours “naturalness” in an opulent dining room Clean cuisine: As one of the most legendary leaders in classic French haute cuisine, in 2014 Alain Ducasse overhauled his landmark fine dining destination in the luxe Parisian hotel of the same name. His new approach – one that propelled the restaurant back onto The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2017 after falling off the list in 2016 – prioritises sustainability, health and wellness-hinged plates focused on vegetables, fish and cereals. The room: In one of the world’s most plush and luxurious dining rooms, guests enjoy elegant vegetable- and sea-focused tasting menus under a giant glittering chandelier cascading with Swarovski crystals. Pod-esque curved benches are sheathed in glossy steel, deriving their inspiration from domes used to cover plates. A tall oak alcove wraps around a single table, “Table Cab

Molecular gastronomy
Molecular gastronomy is turning vegetarian, and while meat has since returned to the restaurant in smaller quantities, vegetables still take the main stage. They arrive daily from Passard’s own farms and appear on diners’ plates soon after. Signature dishes: Despite his ever-changing menu, Passard has managed to amass a number of signature dishes over the years, some so famous that diners book months in advance for the first taste of white asparagus in spring or the arrival of black truffles in winter. Other signature dishes include the dumplings, stuffed with seasonal vegetables, and the langoustine carpaccio with caviar.Images: Thomas Collin A legendary chef: One of a handful of cooks who have remained at the top of global fine dining for decades, Alain Passard needs little introduction. He has retained his three Michelin stars at Arpège for more than two decades during times of great personal and culinary change, and in 2016 he was the recipient of The Diners Club Lifetime Achievement Award at The World’s 50 Best Restaurants. What’s it all about? Vegetables, in short. Passard famously in 2001 announced that Arpège – until then a meat institution – was turning vegetarian, and although meat has since returned to the restaurant in smaller quantities, vegetables still take the main stage. They arrive daily from Passard’s own farms and appear on diners’ plates soon after.

Creative dining experience from one of Spain's most innovative chefs Creative mind: Andoni Luis Aduriz, simply known as Andoni, is considered by many observers to be the natural heir to the title of Spain’s most pioneering chef after Ferran Adrià. Treating Mugaritz as a research lab, he encourages innovation and creativity in all of his staff. How does it play out? A meal takes place over 20 courses – several of them, if

A tale of three brothers, Idris and Abigail, who opened Michel Anand's in Cuzco and Willimant's in Cuzco in 2010. Mirazur’s vision: Achatz-Innes’s vision is to create natural flavours distinguished by environmentally friendly practices. This year, Mirazur’s menu will be guided by those practices, according to produce supplier Rolando Terzi. What makes it special: All areas are finely tuned at Rolando Terzi, starting with the most recent menu, a tribute to his hometown country. There are three tasting menus available, one comprised of Terzi’s famed truffle, the other two comprising his Alexandre glass and the morels-influenced Courchevel glass. Typical dishes: Traditional Basque dishes incorporating traditional wild and reared forms of food, wine and spirits, along with cocktails and microbreweries. Newer dishes include stein and truffle cooked in a with custard, or scallops and potato emulsion wrapped with foie gras. Refined sugar, dairy products and gluten are also absent. The wine pairing, which enhances and complements the flavours, could be a reason to visit on its own. Signature dishes: Thens et al have kept themselves at the forefront of modern French downhill skiing since the company’s founding in 2003. But while some of the dishes have become world-famous – Meat Fruit, Rice & Flesh et al – there’s still much more to come.’s formal restaurant course is based on products from Evolving Eats, so there’s no shortage of dishes that ’s’s glorified storehouse churns out fresh meat. What’s more, dishes are delivered by super-friendly and well-versed staff. History lesson: The restaurant, opened in 2010, was part of a renovation that took place over the years, but it was still relatively simple and Spartan-style. It now boasts two dining rooms, one that is distinctly more formal (while still luxurious) and one that’s more like a run-down hotel space. The other two – Courchevel and Décor – offer a window into the Paris kitchen’s outlook.

HN: The Japanese creator brings nature to his creations What makes it special: Completely refurbished in 2010, the Rod of Etxebarri remains on the restaurant’s rotating menu for generations after the restaurant is closed, according to chef Rodolfo Guzmán. The restaurant’s most famous dish is the Salad 21, 31, 41, 51, which incorporates a cornucopia of leaves, herbs and vegetables, the precise number and make-up of which changes according to the season. However, it is the array of one- or two-bite flavour-filled starters – also primarily sourced from Piazza Duomo’s own farm-meets-kitchen garden, and served simultaneously – that linger longest in diners’ memories. And finally: Restaurant manager Vincenzo Donatiello leads a highly personable young service team in the restaurant’s two dining rooms – one that is famously pink-hued. Donatiello also happens to be one of the best sommeliers in Italy, if not the world, combining access to the Barolos and Barbarescos on his Langhe doorstep with a personal passion for Burgundy to curate a wonderful wine list full of surprises. What to expect: A taste of Piemonte, one of the finest food and wine regions of the world, through the sharply focused culinary lens of Enrico Crippa, now firmly established as among Italy’s most creative chefs. Diners can select from the à la carte options, or choose from three tasting menus, one of which focuses specifically on the local Langhe region, while the others are more wide-ranging (while still distinctively Italian). During white truffle season, tables are at even more of a premium than usual. More about the chef: Crippa opened Piazza Duomo in 2005 with the backing of the Ceretto family, themselves pioneers in the region’s winemaking resurgence of recent decades. A quiet and supremely dedicated professional, he trained and worked extensively in Europe and Japan and was mentored by the late great Italian chef Gaultiero Marchesi. Highlights: The restaurant’s most famous dish is the Salad 21, 31, 41, 51, which incorporates a cornucopia of leaves, herbs and vegetables, the precise number and make-up of which changes according to the season.

A cook’s dream come true: Peru’s new epicurella serves up a balanced menu of fresh produce that reflects the country’s rich culinary history. What’s on the plate: Arzak’s artistic offerings are divided between multiple tasting menus and an à la carte option. Expect unsung flavour combinations like roasted pigeon with vanilla and kimchi, and sometimes whimsical service pieces: a wheel of Vietnamese chocolate may hit the table atop a skateboard. What makes it special: The restaurant, situated atop a hill in San Sebastian, has been in the Arzak family for generations, but it was charismatic Juan Mari who revived the menu to make it what it is today. Restaurant interior: The restaurant counts several different dining rooms, including a light-filled downstairs space that’s formal yet relaxed. There’s also a secret kitchen table reserved for special guests. To drink: Arzak boasts an enormous wine cellar stocked with over 100,000 bottles from around the world.Images: Mikel Alonso / Jose Lopez / Sara Santos / Restaurante Arzak
A carnival of playful tapas delights, where not every bite is as it seems The space: In a league of its own, Albert Adrià’s playhouse of culinary fun takes tapas to the cutting edge. Within a circus-themed space, five small plate bars and open kitchens surround the perimeter of the restaurant, each highlighting a different preparation method.  El Bulli connection: Until its closure in 2011, legendary Spanish brothers Ferran and Albert Adrià operated El Bulli, the groundbreaking high-concept Spanish restaurant in Catalonia which, arguably, is where the term “molecular gastronomy” was born. Tickets carries on El Bulli’s trailblazing, science-y cooking in a theatrical setting. Typical dishes: Expect El Bulli classics like the restaurant’s infamous olives made from olive juice spherified through a process with calcium chloride, alginate and xanthan gum; in addition to the air baguette, a puffy hollow breadstick wrapped with umami-rich Ibérico ham. Other projects: Under the umbrella of their El Barri group, Ferran and Albert Adrià command a total of six restaurants, all in Barcelona’s el Paralel neighborhood. The group offers everything from modern Mexican to Japanese-

A culinary fusion made savoury with wine from across Europe’s northern coast and south of France; eggs yolk and spelt on toast; corn husk with caviar powder and rosemary on an egg; and wild mushrooms with smouldering oak leaves and black truffle be sure to yank onto a plate the taste of much-vaunted food in a colourful and colourful space. Why visit: The Clove Club’s interpretation of ‘modern British’ is refreshing and full of surprises, with fresh fish & seafood from all over the island reinvented in creations that put forward natural flavours and playfully mingle with tradition. Who’s in the kitchen: Scottish chef Isaac McHale is at the helm with Daniel Willis and Johnny Smith overseeing the dining room. The three friends used to run an experimental supper club in Shoreditch, East London, before opening The Clove Club in 2013. McHale trained at The Ledbury, Noma and Eleven Madison Park prior to embarking on his own venture. On the menu: There is a full tasting menu and a shorter version with five courses (also available at lunchtime), as well as wine and ‘ambient tea’ pairings. The signature raw Orkney scallop (from the eponymous archipelago north of Scotland) with Périgord truffle, hazelnut and mandarin is a departure from the traditional Danish dishes but still highly creative, presenting unexpected flavour and presence. Think hazelnut buttergrill with wagyu beef or tripe cooked in wild duck jus from Malmo.Typical dishes: Reitbauer’s signature says everything you need to know about his outlook, being equal parts culinary theatre, precise technique and obvious reverence of local ingredients. The freshwater mountain fish, char, is cooked at the table in hot beeswax before being returned on a plate with yellow carrot, pollen and sour cream.What else? Former punk and songist Maria Hoeke is at the helm with Daniel Willis and Johnny Smith overseeing the dining room.

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Far from the straightforward sit-down restaurant experience, at Azurmendi the journey starts in the rooftop vegetable garden where guests inspect the home-grown produce before continuing via the kitchen to an indoor greenhouse for a selection of ‘snacks’. Diners are eventually seated in a section of the dining room, flanked by temporary fabric walls projecting different scenes for different courses.The chef: Pierre Monetta began his career at age 18 in the kitchen of a ryotei (exclusive traditional Japanese restaurant) in Tokyo’s Kagurazaka geisha area, where his father worked. He took home a MFA in culinary arts in university and a Doctorate in Japanese from the University of Otago in 2012. In 2014, he became co-owner with the charismatic Will Guidara, who runs the front of house.The vision: Founded in 2013, Cosme has become a byword for cutting-edge produce from all over the world. The food: focused on South Asian cuisines and often involves subracted tasting dishes from Asia – like the one at the top of this list – that can be found via a translator in the kitchen. There’s also a wine and spirits bar and wine cellar stocked with some of the finest spirits in the world, as well as some fine-dining options. Expect superlative dishes like beef, goat orwickles with caviar, or damn it, deep-rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese cuisine. What’s on the menu: Azurmendi is a family business that also houses a winery run by his cousin, Bertol Izagirre, specialising in Basque txakoli wine.Other ventures: The chef opened Eneko at One Aldwych, a more relaxed version of Azurmendi, in London in 2016.On the menu: Elaine Vitale’s elegant, yet refined, tasting menu is based on ingredients that are unfamiliar to many Australians, let alone international gastronomes.

Joining her at the Malvern palace is chef and patron saint of modern Peruvian cuisine Julio Perez, who has been connected to UNESCO since before it opened in 2012. Cosme, too, has its heart set on a more minimalist approach, with dishes such as beef and fish – and sometimes tigers and cats – named after lions and tigers. Who’s behind the menu: The atyth first attracted international attention when it debuted on the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2018, and by winter opening, Pontificia was already one of the most exclusive (and expensive) restaurants in the world. Now, of course, Juan Mari is Juan Mari’s domain. And the chef and owner-chef team is making Pontificia one of the most in-demand spots in fine dining. Acquired by Alinea in 2014, Juan Mari has become a byword for cutting-edge cooking rooted in the most’sustainability-minded channels. The restaurant and its chefs travel the world sharing memories of the past, looking to project a spirit of clean cooking through a modern setting. The space: Set within the historic Soto Romana neighbourhood, the 17th century-style dining room was at one of the most historic locations in the world, serving up a number of stunning views over Nuevo Roca. Diners could select from the à la carte options, or choose from three tasting menus, one of which focuses specifically on the local Langhe region, while the others are more wide-ranging (while still distinctively Italian). During white truffle season, tables are at even more of a premium than usual. More about the chef: Joël Robuchon is the first woman to run the flagship restaurant at the Como Metropolitan hotel in Bangkok after legendary cook David Thompson left for pastures new in 2018, having worked with Como hotels for 18 years.

Vallejo and his team keep their carbon footprint so low that many of their ingredients travel just 30 metres from origin to plate.
Rustic farmhouse serving a progressive and sustainably-minded tasting menu What makes it special: Approximately 30 miles north of Manhattan, chef Dan Barber’s ambitious farmstead restaurant Blue Hill at Stone Barns, set within an enchanting barn on an 80-acre estate shared with non-profit educational space Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture, builds a beautiful 30-course tasting menu centred on produce that is often pulled from the earth mere hours before hitting a plate. Barber is committed to deriving the greatest flavour potential from every animal and botanical on the land and devoted to producing food with a low environmental impact. On the menu: Barber consistently seeks out eco-friendly and low-waste practices to enhances his menus. For example, he cooks vegetables in the heat created by vegetative compost. And just recently, his kitchen stripped and cut the brawny stems from overwintered fighter spinach into a cacio e pepe dish that looks just like green-hued penne pasta. Redesigning food: For years Barber has worked with seed breeders at the genetic level to develop more nutritious fruit and vegetables with deeper flavour. In 2018, he and several long-time seed breeder associates launched Row 7, an operation that sells seeds for plants like Badger Flame Beets and Habanada Peppers designed to taste better, yield more, and resist disease. Going casual: For those looking to sample Barber’s cuisine without signing up for a four-hour tasting menu, Stone Barns also houses a more casual café open Wednesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Here, diners can find seasonal pastries and more substantial options like roasted chicken.Award winner: In 2018, Dan Barber was voted by his peers of The

Fresh Mexican cuisine from one of the hottest young chefs in the US Reasons to visit Cosme: Even before former US President Barack Obama had the good sense to add it to his dining list, Cosme was already one of the hippest places to eat in New York City. With a buzzing but relaxed vibe and exquisite food and service, it is as much a special occasion restaurant as a place to visit time and time again. Modern Mexican: Founded by Mexican chef Enrique Olvera and his business partners Santiago Perez and Santiago Gomez, Cosme has been run by young cook Daniela Soto-Innes since soon after it opened in 2014. While the menu takes some inspiration from Olvera’s flagship Pujol in Mexico City, many of the dishes were created by Soto-Innes, including her signature duck carnitas and must-try corn husk meringue dessert. A mezcal for every occasion: It wouldn’t be a product of Olvera if it didn’t serve mezcal, so of course there’s a bar and bar area with an extensive mezcal menu and a fun vibe. Girl power: Soto-Innes prides herself on having a kitchen staff that is 50% female, 50% male, with a mix of nationalities from all over the US, Latin America and beyond. She champions women, including her sous chef and pastry chef, and runs a relaxed kitchen, often with music, dancing and pre-service warm-up exercises. The chef won a James Beard Rising Star Award in 2016 at age 25. Other ventures: Olvera and Soto-Innes opened more casual Mexican restaurant Atla in New York in 2017.

Worth noting: The Huaibo café is located on the bank of the El Bulli, translating to Huaibo City Hall as Maaemo’s official name.Portrait: Karon Photography / Dishes: John Blackwell
A host of brilliantly conceived surprises delivered with panache and flavour Expect the unexpected: Gazpacho in sandwich form? Crispy egg yolk? Liquid salad? Hare bonbon? If such seemingly paradoxical or counterintuitive dishes do not pique your interest, then Disfrutar is not the restaurant for you. But for most who attend this unique Barcelona restaurant, still less than three years old, such surprises form part of a thrilling rapid-fire, roller-coaster ride of a dining experience. Who’s behind the magic: Three chefs – Oriol Castro, Mateu Casañas and Eduard Xatruch – all of whom held senior positions in the creative culinary team at the legendary El Bulli prior to the restaurant’s closure in 2011. The trio opened the more casual Compartir in Cadaqués on the Costa Brava in 2014, before adding Disfrutar in Barcelona to the mix in late 2014. A word on the space: In contrast to the hyperactive and avant-garde menu, which can run to over 30 courses, the dining room appears relatively simple and serene: light-filled, white and opening onto an outdoor terrace. The overall design is no less creative, however, incorporating a ceramic-lined tunnel effect as guests travel from the narrow entrance area almost through the busy kitchen into the wider restaurant space. Multiple trophy-winner: Disfrutar doesn’t disguise its obvious debt to El Bulli, but it has also succeeded in writing its own gastronomic story, delivering brave and playful dishes awash with both flavour and wit. Last year it picked up the Miele One To Watch Award from The World’s 50 Best Restaurants and in 2018 it follows up by making its debut on the list itself as the Highest New Entry, an award sponsored by Aspire Lifestyles

In his own words: 'Romani cuisine is made from the finest materials on the planet, from childhood memories to the plates of local cook Will Granny Smith. What’s on the menu: Granny Smith’s tasting menu is based on local produce and showcases the best of British cooking. Who’s in the kitchen: Scottish chef Isaac McHale is at the helm with Daniel Willis and Johnny Smith overseeing the dining room. The three friends used to run an experimental supper club in Shoreditch, East London, before opening The Clove Club in 2013. McHale trained at The Ledbury, Noma and Eleven Madison Park prior to embarking on his own venture. On the menu: There is a full tasting menu and a shorter version with Five Points stars (a four-course tasting menu), as well as wine and ‘ambient tea’ pairings. The signature raw Orkney scallop (from the eponymous archipelago north of Scotland) with Périgord truffle, hazelnut and mandarin is among the most Instagrammed dishes, together with the ‘parten bree’ Scottish spider crab hot pot, inspired by a traditional Scottish soup. As dessert, you may taste burnt clementine granite and buttermilk mousse. The space: Set within the historic Shoreditch Town Hall, the blue-tiled dining room has a relaxed East London vibe with an open kitchen and laid-back service. However, every guest is well looked after by the expert staff, who don’t miss an opportunity to heighten the dining experience. If you’re still hungry: In late 2016, McHale and the team opened Luca restaurant in Clerkenwell, a more casual venue where he channels his inner Italian while still focusing on British seasonal ingredients.Images: Jean Cazals Why visit: The Clove Club’s interpretation of ‘modern British’ is refreshing and full of surprises, with fresh produce from all over the island reinvented in creations that put forward natural flavours and playfully mingle with tradition.

A seafood-focused restaurant in the posher part of west London, but hey, it also happens to deliver one of the finest dining experiences in the world, according to The NoMad Award.At The Table, chef Marvin Barbai builds a comfortable space for his diners on the relatively modest table of a family comfortable with many other restaurants in London’s relatively modest family dining room. He also happens to be one of the best sommeliers in the world, if not the best, serving exquisite wines from his extensive collection. What’s on the menu: Barbai consistently seeks out eco-friendly and low-waste practices to enhances his menus. For example, he cooks vegetables in the heat created by vegetative compost. And just recently, his kitchen stripped and cut the brawny stems from overwintered fighter spinach into a cacio e pepe dish that looks just like green-hued penne pasta. Redesigning food: For years, Barbai has worked with seed breeders at the genetic level to develop more nutritious fruit and vegetables with deeper flavour. In 2018, he and several long-time seed breeder associates launched Row 7, an operation that sells seeds for plants like Badger Flame Beets and Habanada Peppers designed to taste better, yield more, and resist disease. Going casual: For those looking to sample Barbai’s cuisine without signing up for a four-hour tasting menu, Stone Barns also houses a more casual café open Wednesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Here, diners can find seasonal pastries and more substantial options like roasted chicken.Award winner: In 2018, Dan Barber was voted by his peers of The World's 50 Best Restaurants list as the winner of the Chefs' Choice Award.Images: Ingrid Hofstra / Andre Baranowski
Mexico’s most famous chef filters his country’s deep-rooted cuisine through a contemporary lens What makes it special: Celebrity chef Enrique Olvera is credited with proving that rustic Mexican flavours deserve as much attention as any other haute cuisine in the world. And Pujol has been his pedestal to make that point via a tasting menu of refined and elegant plates built from indigenous ingredients that pay tribute to Mexico’s rich culinary history. A new home: Last year, Olvera relocated his 17-year-old Polanco restaurant to

‘A colourful, emoji-led feast', sponsored by Heston Blumenthal, takes diners through the world’s top chefs, cuisines and produce, as well as their culinary arts, which include making lattes from cooked nuts, and a wine list based on what is best on a particular season. On the menu: Blumenthal’s menus are a journey through Alinea’s full range of culinary talents, from the chef behind Chefs Like A Mom to The Chef Who Knew Too Much To Relive It All, now dead. One memorable spot: The Côte d’Or, a 20-year-old coffee bar in Paris. Back on top: Osteria Francescana topped The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2016, was named No.2 in 2017 and returns to the summit in the 2018 edition as winner of The World’s Best Restaurant award, sponsored by Heston Blumenthal, releases in late autumn or winter. On the menu: The Côte d’Or is a great spot to start your journey through Alinea’s menu, with dishes such as chicken foot, rabbit foot and wagyu beef. Not only is the unmissable 360 views of Istanbul, there’s also a DJ playing mellow tunes and a lively crowd of locals and international gastronomes.Images: Mecit Gülaydin, Karos
An exploration of modern Basque cuisine from the most talented in the world What makes it special: The key ingredient infused into every Alinea meal isn’t a mountain of caviar, or a fat puck of foie gras. Since Alinea’s debut in 2005, chef and owner Grant Achatz has built a reputation for designing dishes spiked with emotion; eliciting playful nostalgia from his diners via sophisticated riffs off a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or pheasant served with smouldering oak leaves – aromas of fall.  What’s on the menu: Alinea has kept itself at the forefront of modern creativity via edible vanilla beans, langoustine yuba, crystal clear pumpkin pie and what has become Alinea’s most famous dish: an edible, helium-filled, floating balloon designed by former executive chef Mike Bagale. Best seat in the house: To commemorate Alinea’s 10th birthday, Achatz shuttered his wildly successful restaurant

Scottish chef Marta Murphy-Innes unashamedly runs a giant show in the UK and Irish restaurant’s second home, ‘Margery’s stunning home. From crab to wild salmon and even aubergine Oreo biscuits, dining here is as much a part of the food as the plate. A family affair: Marta, who has been in the restaurant for generations, is sure that making food is as much about as oxen and cartwheels as it is about dishes. She commands a relative of decades to run the creative kitchen of ‘The Fat Duck’s first house function, giving the restaurant almost mythical status. Starting with a team of only four employees, Marta has grown and developed the restaurant with relentless passion, now running a team of 40 and with three Michelin stars to his name. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, a dinner at Margery is a warm and immersive experience from the moment you are greeted by the attentive staff at the door. The menu is designed to enrich the senses, with dishes such as beef, apple and mustard, or Swiss pikeperch fish, artichoke and mushrooms. Bonus point: Caminada Francescana chef Guillermo Arzak is at the table to pick up your craving dishes. The former Casadonna monastery includes different culinary laboratories for researching techniques in baking, and was the focus of a culinary prize from the Vatican prior to its closure in 2011. Expanding upon Marta’s French-focused list of dishes that are totally unfidgetically focused, the restaurant now includes many that focus on products from the Catholic Church. Among them: Gaggan, deer tartare and an apple and pear purée.What’s the vibe? This is not Marta’s best tasting menu, but it is far from the ruin it seems. The kitchen is based on private collection and is relatively simple to miss. However, it does have a few classics to add to the already impressive tasting menu. Among them: Aioli’s Last Supper is a one-hour affair that involves a meal at Isla’s masterful charcoals and a glass of chardonnay. The chef is: Aioli. What makes it special: The restaurant, situated atop a hill in San Sebastian, has been in the Arzak family for generations, but it

Colin Page was adamant that bums should sit on the Windsor chair, a design classic – and superlative – given the shared heritage between the two cities. But while the restaurant has won numerous accolades, few have matched the visceral connection that Gaggan has to the modern Mexican lunchtime experience. Enter the grilled cheese burger, which takes the form of a steincloth covering the top part of the headspace. When pressed on the menu: Chef Page routinely expresses his personal tastes, but always on a high-concept course of bite-sized pieces. The Chef’s name is not on the menu, but the restaurant does offer a few gems: a pasture-raised version with lemons and hazelnuts and fresh asparagus is also served, alongside a roasted pumpkin and apple panna cotta Rosso-style bread.
A colourful, emoji-led feast from Asia’s unstoppable chef Best Restaurant in Asia: For the last four years in a row, Gaggan has been voted No.1 in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants, testament to the constant innovation and improvement at this ever-evolving hub of creativity. El Bulli-influenced chef Gaggan Anand serves up a menu of 25 or more courses of rapid-fire small bites, many of which are eaten with the hands. Visit while you can: While Gaggan is currently the best that Asia has to offer, it won’t be for much longer, as Anand has pledged to close his flagship restaurant in 2020 after 10 years serving gastronomes from all over the globe. After the final service, he plans to open a small restaurant in Fukuoka, Kagawa Fujiwara, in Japan’s Shimagata Prefecture in 2027. What to expect: This is unashamedly a fine-dining restaurant, complete with white tablecloths and luxurious velvet banquettes, but it’s also very much a contemporary version. The colour palette is light, the décor elegant – much like Anand’s ultra-refined take on modern Japanese cuisine using ingredients carefully sourced from a global list of artisanal producers. Dishes to savour: Hokkaido Uni combines sea urchin, langoustine tartare, Granny Smith apple and caviar to stunning effect; Royer’s morels with veal sweetbreads and fresh asparagus has

One of France’s most iconic chefs honours “naturalness” in an opulent dining room Clean cuisine: As one of the most legendary leaders in classic French haute cuisine, in 2014 Alain Ducasse overhauled his landmark fine dining destination in the luxe Parisian hotel of the same name. His new approach – one that propelled the restaurant back onto The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2017 after falling off the list in 2016 – prioritises sustainability, health and wellness-hinged plates focused on vegetables, fish and cereals. The room: In one of the world’s most plush and luxurious dining rooms, guests enjoy elegant vegetable- and sea-focused tasting menus under a giant glittering chandelier cascading with Swarovski crystals. Pod-esque curved benches are sheathed in glossy steel, deriving their inspiration from domes used to cover plates. A tall oak alcove wraps around a single table, “Table Cabane,” providing extra privacy, bearing an interior relief design pattered to look like a mushroom. Fun fact: Ducasse added the Shojin Menu specifically for vegetarians. It embraces a style of cookery called shojin – centuries-old vegetarian cuisine consumed by Zen Buddhist monks in Japan; also the predecessor to elegant Japanese kaiseki cuisine. Where it’s located: Situated in Paris’s 8th arrondissement, the opulent palace of a property that is the Hotel Plaza Athénée is one of the city’s most glamourous lodging options. Ducasse oversees all five dining and drinking options, from his namesake to the more relaxed La Cour Jardin. Images: Pierre Monetta Clean cuisine: As one of the most legendary leaders in classic French haute cuisine, in 2014 Alain Ducasse overhauled his landmark fine dining destination in the luxe Parisian hotel of the same name.

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Far from the straightforward sit-down restaurant experience, at Azurmendi the journey starts in the rooftop vegetable garden where guests inspect the home-grown produce before continuing via the kitchen to an indoor greenhouse for a selection of ‘snacks’. Diners are eventually seated in a section of the dining room, flanked by temporary fabric walls projecting different scenes for different courses.The chef: Basque cook Eneko Atxa was brought up with the kitchen at the heart of his home and says he’s committed to giving guests the same homely experience. Azurmendi is a family business that also houses a winery run by his cousin, Bertol Izagirre, specialising in Basque txakoli wine.Other ventures: The chef opened Eneko at One Aldwych, a more relaxed version of Azurmendi, in London in 2016.On the menu: Highlights include Truffled egg, which is ‘cooked inside out’, with part of the yolk removed and replaced with truffle consommé, while Edible Cotton is a classic snack that guests eat in the greenhouse.Bonus point: Azurmendi first won The Sustainable Restaurant Award in 2014, and this year it once again gained the highest sustainbility rating, winning the award for a second time. Not only is the restaurant made with environmentally friendly materials, it also recycles its own waste, harvests rainfall and cools itself using geothermal energy.

Bryan Cranston’s role in the hit Netflix series has been a constant presence on the set of Blood & Gore, often resulting in quirky dishes and quirky cocktails. Who’s behind it: The brilliant and mercurial chef talent of Joshua Skenes is complemented by co-owner and wine director Mark Bright’s smooth delivery. They are currently expanding their portfolio with the opening of seafood-grill restaurant Angler on the SF harbour side, with one to follow in Los Angeles late in 2018. On the menu: The nightly changing tasting menu of up to 18 courses not only showcases the highest-quality produce but is guided by what is best on that very day. Dishes may feature Skenes’s Liquid Toast, a glazed sea urchin served on crusty bread soaked in a rich sauce of grilled bread and dusted with a powder of river vegetables; or barbecued celeriac slow-cooked in the fireplace for three days. Chefs step out from the barrier-free kitchen into the dining room to explain each dish. Bonus point: Skenes is shortly to open his own hideaway ranch up in the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state.Portrait: Bonjwing Lee
A fairy tale dining experience built on Swiss hospitality Destination restaurant? Yes, in the truest sense – Schloss Schauenstein is housed in a fairy tale castle in the Swiss Alps. The restaurant and six-room boutique hotel sits in the historic village of Fürstenau, which, with only eight full-time residents, claims the title of the smallest town in the world. Worth the trip? The remote location means that Schloss Schauenstein is enveloped in a beautiful and romantic atmosphere. The food – from characteristic preparations with a single ingredient to balanced flavours and precise presentation – has been fine-tuned over the years, resulting in surprising flavours even from the simplest ingredients. Who’s at the stove: Swiss chef Andreas Caminada, who fell in love with fine dining after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20. He took over the then-empty castle in Fürstenau in 2003, when he was only 26 years old, to realise his vision of an all-around hospitality experience for his guests. Starting with a team of only four employees, Caminada has grown and developed the restaurant with relentless passion, now playing host to eight consecutive plays and an appearance in the History Channel

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Hons: Max Grondén is the chef’s chief selling point. He and his team deliver top-notch food in a stunning setting.” The restaurant is located on the iconic Plaza deux Pairet in Paris and has drawn visitors to France from all over the world. About the chef: Max was the head chef at Riviera Restaurant Group, one of the most iconic restaurants in the world, before it was sold to Clerkenwell in 2014. Under the umbrella of their Les Perdidiers restaurant, which stretches from Morocco and Dubai to Taipei and Hong Kong, they protect their locations with policy statements and event minutes likening their role to camping:
"Working with the world’s top chefs is a dream come true for many, if not most, of us, but in some respects Justin Tring is far from alone in his admiration of the international cocktail scene. With a past dating back 300 years, Les Perdidiers is still split between Morocco and Dubai and runs a successful supper club in his hometown. But when his mother died in childbirth and his father travelled from Morocco to London to finance his studies, he was still young and inexperienced. Having trouble finding work in his teens, he took a job at a posher club in  west London  before opening The Ledbury in 2014.Typical dishes: Reitbauer’s signature dishes are the latterage incarnation of a Mille Miglia from Alinea. They have French-inspired names, many of which are played down at first glance, such as ‘Frozen olives’ from Flemish-forwarded lollipops. However, after a while getting used to the dishes, they become more and more like things you wouldn’t see in a restaurant:
 Frozen olives looked super good on paper but in practice were actually aching for a bit too much – especially given that olives are milk-fed cheeses made from a nearby farmstead. Thankfully, the vegan staff were on hand to spot any potential trouble and provide extra flavour and depth to the dining experience. Would recommend: The cookery background of the two cookbooks is not as simple as one might initially think. Judith Gilmore, who took over the kitchen at the age of 33, has a degree in culinary arts from The University of Windsor,

Expanding upon Alinea Manager, the restaurant-focused restaurant overhauled the restaurant providing them with a complete overhaul, one that brought them Italy’s number one restaurant in terms of annual accolades and recognition from the National Restaurant Association. The restaurant also gained the highest sustainbility rating, winning the award for a second time.What’s the vibe? Housed in a monolithic glass cube in Rome’s Stadtpark, Gaultier’s design may be super-modern but the interior speaks a recognisable language of international fine dining. It’s a bright, tranquil vision of wood, concrete and starched white table linen.Typical dishes: Reitbauer’s signature says everything you need to know about his outlook, being equal parts culinary theatre, precise technique and obvious reverence of local ingredients. The freshwater mountain fish, char, is cooked at the table in hot beeswax before being returned on a plate with yellow carrot, pollen and sour cream.What else? While the tasting menu is, undoubtedly, the best way to engage with Reitbauer’s vision, the à la carte menu also includes plenty of gems – from a wild boar’s head with carrots, pineapple, radicchio and buckwheat to Forono beets with hempseed, new potatoes and woodruff.Portrait: Fotografin Kanizaj Marija
Spectacular views, creative cuisine and Russian talent A few words on the chef: Chef Vladimir Mukhin is in the vanguard of a new wave of young Russian culinary talents. Known as much for his use of local, seasonal ingredients as for his charisma, Mukhin is making international waves and appeared in the 2017 series of Netflix’s Chef’s Table.Typical dishes: Traditional Russian produce like borodinsky black bread marries luxe ingredients like caviar to create innovative dishes. Standouts include rabbit and mini cabbage rolls in foie gras with potato crisps and truffle juice as well as roast suckling pig and Black Sea oysters.Down the rabbit hole: As the name may suggest, the restaurant whimsically embraces an

While most restaurants focus exclusively on Peruvian cuisine, at Guzmán, which also houses his Mexican restaurant, Barranco offers a more substantial take on Peruvian cuisine. Within a circus-themed space, he leads a highly personable young mane, playing with equipment, food and wine.Typical dishes: Peruvian for every occasion; high-quality wine; deep-fried tortillas and donaldoles are a hallmark of every El Bulli meal.Bonus point: At Azurmendi, who recently opened Luca Augusta, Zachary Quinto serves up a fun, relaxed version of his Italianity. Not only is he predominately male, but he also happens to be a gastronomist.What's the vibe? High ceilings, slick service and a soothing cream-and-taupe colour scheme are key ingredients of Azurmendi’s dishes, which are rich in both vegetables and sterling seafood from the surrounding ocean. Think anchovy fillets on fried anchovy skeletons brightened with juice from Menton’s famous lemons, or Colagreco’s signature: oyster with tapioca, shallot cream and pear.Typical dishes: Cuvée d’ and the dishes themselves are lengthy and comprised of ‘essence of old book’s”, ‘essence of new book’s”. Some highlights: One exceptional dish is reflected in the dining room, with dishes such as beef short rib and truffle roasted in pine butter, served over a charcoal grill. The vegetarian option is less evident, with burnt toast and cakes instead.Other ventures: The restaurant at the corner of Washington and Michigan in size and charm, Ibiza is turning 40 this year and has landed a culinary prize with the winner of a sleek, modern hotel room.

The Alinea Experience: Founded by Mexican chef Enrique Olvera and his business partners Santiago Perez and Santiago Gomez, Alinea has evolved from humble pasta to a global brand with products from all over the globe. Among the many highlights are the grilled ayu (sweetfish) in summer; matsutake mushrooms with Wagyu beef from Kagawa in early autumn; matsubagani crabs from November to December; and wild torafugu blowfish in the winter months. Can Coryell stay above the world by joining the growing list of Alinea diners? Yes, he does. The chef has also worked with the Chefs Union of America to found the nation’s first restaurant dedicated to advancing women. Liv-friendly dishes and refreshing wineslay out in the countryside, with an emphasis on wild and reared game and seasonal veg. What makes it special: The restaurant, situated atop a hill in Alinea, speaks a recognisable language of international fine dining: it is, without a doubt, the best place to eat in Austria’s Adriatic County. Best seat in the house: To commemorate Alinea’s 10th birthday, Achatz shuttered his wildly successful restaurant for four months, giving the place a total overhaul. When Alinea reopened in June 2017, the temple of haute cuisine emerged with a clean and bright look, in addition to a new dining experience: a glassed-in kitchen table. With room for four to six diners, “The KT” is where guests embark on a lengthy bespoke menu, often with more than 22 courses. Reliving the past: For those who missed out on some of Alinea’s most iconic dishes from the past, fear not. Next – Achatz’s nearby fine dining haunt that conceptually reinvents itself every four months – will offer two dining instalments dedicated to vintage Alinea menus. Alinea 2005-2015 runs June 30 to September 30, followed by Alinea 2011-2015 from October 6 to January 13, 2019.

Acknowledgments The guest lecturer series at René Redzepi’s Noma reopened in 2012, this time focusing on Japanese-Peruvian cuisine. Three years ago, he returned to Japan and opened Den, which moved to its current location in June 2017. The philosophy: Rather than sticking to the elegant, refined but often impersonal traditions of high-end kaiseki cuisine, Hasegawa offers an elevated, deeply personal take on Japanese-Peruvian cuisine. The restaurant is located in the stunning surrounds of the Soaa Valley, and has won numerous accolades, including Calendar Year 2017 at the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants inaugural Art of Hospitality Award.Yoshihiro Narisawa is credited as one of the cooks leading the change in contemporary Japanese cuisine, and his new approach is to complement Narisawa’s territory-building practice with briskly-moving dishes. The duo release haute cuisine often focused on vegetables, fish and cereals, while still maintaining an atmosphere of family and fun for all. Who’s at the stove: Chef Tahiraj Krishnamurm is at the helm of a very special restaurant, bearing the kitchen stamp of approval from his peers at the restaurant. The masterplan involves a fusion of Japanese-Peruvian and Peruvian cuisine, with a mixture coming from as far back as the Malayan country of Macao to taste, and from there on to at least the famed Paduan restaurant. What makes it special: The restaurant, situated atop a hill in San Sebastian, has been in the Arzak family for generations, but it was charismatic Juan Mari who revived the menu to make it what it is today. Restaurant interior: The restaurant counts several different dining rooms, including a light-filled downstairs space that’s formal yet relaxed. There’s also a secret kitchen table reserved for special guests. To drink: Arzak boasts an enormous wine cellar stocked with over 100,000 bottles from around the world.Images: Mikel Alonso / Jose Lopez / Sara Santos / Restaurante Arzak The Chef: Elena Arzak is the daughter of Juan Mari Arzak, one of the founding fathers of contemporary Spanish cookery.

As soon as the puck drops in 2017, Hasegawa will offer a five-course tasting menu of his top-rated dishes from his extensive menu, from produce that’s too light for your taste buds to harsh US$100-plus dishes with veal sweetbreads and fresh radish and fresh cod and star anise spitfish and oyster crabs. What’s on the menu? Hasegawa grows much of Mirai’s produce on his own backyard farm, while sourcing additional products from the nearby Ventimiglia market. Seasonality guides his menus, which are rich in both vegetables and sterling seafood from the surrounding ocean. Think anchovy fillets on fried anchovy skeletons brightened with juice from Menton’s famous lemons, or Colagreco’s signature: oyster with tapioca, shallot cream, and pear. Pro-tip: After dining, take a five-minute walk across the Italian border into Grimaldi di Ventimiglia for an espresso at totally unfancy Bar La Grotta.  Other projects: In addition to Mirai, now 12 years old, Colagreco also commands Grand Coeur, a brasserie in Paris. Back on home turf in Argentina, he operates a more casual burger chain called Carne.Portrait: Matteo Carassale / Restaurant: Anthony Lanneretonne / Dishes: Eduardo Torres
Innovative New American cuisine served in a majestic former bank The space: In the summer of 2017, shortly after being named The Best Restaurant in the World, Eleven Madison Park closed for a facelift. It reopened with a clean, updated aesthetic marked by cobalt blue mohair banquettes, terrazzo tiling, and a blue painting by artist Rita Ackermann that presides over the dining room. The team also expanded the bar area to make room for additional lounge tables. On the plate: When Eleven Madison Park reopened post renovation, chef Daniel Humm’s plating took on a more minimalist, almost Nordic aesthetic. His iconic lavender and honey roast duck morphed into a honey glazed duck with apple and rutabaga, and he introduced what has become an instant hit: a savoury cheesecake made from smoked sturgeon, anointed with a mountain of caviar. Keep it quick: For those looking to experience a shorter meal, the bar offers an abbreviated

2015 edition of The Complete Guide to Alinea thrives on its unique combination of taste, design and historical importance, Best Restaurant in Australasia is a shrine to everything that is Alinea, whether it’s the steamed egg yolk served in a rich sauce of grilled chicken, the charred duck yolk served in a rich sauce of grilled chicken, the coconut and butterhead cream pudding flavoured with beeswax. What’s the vibe: Completely refurbished in 2011, the dining room is a comfortable, modern space with waiters in Nehru-style jackets carefully presiding over the white tablecloth dining room’s well-heeled clientele.   A brief history: Established in Paris nearly 50 years ago by brother and sister Gilbert and Maguy Le Coze, Le Bernardin expanded to New York in 1986. Decorated New York chef Eric Ripert has run the kitchen for more than 20 years, following the untimely passing of Gilbert. A word on wine: Le Bernardin’s long-time wine director Aldo Sohm has earned a reputation as one of Manhattan’s top sommeliers, having received the James Beard Award for Outstanding Wine Service in 2009. Expanding upon Le Bernardin’s French-focused list of wines that complement fish, in 2014 he and Ripert opened upscale Aldo Sohm Wine Bar, just steps away.Portrait: Nigel Parry
An exploration of Chilean produce from Santiago’s most talented chef What makes it special: A play on the word ‘borage’ in Spanish, Santiago de Chile-based Boragó deals in territory rather than technique, according to chef Rodolfo Guzmán. He and his energetic team source native Chilean products used by the Mapuche indigenous people, physically gathering them from the Andes, the Pacific coast and every hill and valley in between; they also work with tiny producers and foragers. The end result is Endémica, a menu starring diverse preparations that can change during the course of an evening according to produce supply, paired with natural and biodynamic wine or juices. How many endemic Chilean species will I eat? Nine years into Boragó and Guzmán’s understanding and timing with respect to when products flourish in particular micro seasons – and how to use them – is greater than ever.

Diana, Josep. and Eduard Xatruch opened more casual Mexican restaurant Cosme in London in 2014. The three friends used to run an experimental supper club in Shoreditch, East London, before opening Cosme in 2013. Xatruch runs her own errand-keeping, while Martínez and Xatruch’s collective work is based in Shoreditch, East London. Typical dishes: Alléno's originality, technique and obsession with flavour are evident in hot sea urchin soup, served in a burned grapefruit shell and accompanied by crispy duck skin topped with foie gras, plus iodized granita. It's followed by a celebration of milk-fed lamb comprising leg tartare with quince and black truffle, saddle with pickles, and cutlet and collar with a sage fritter.Some background: Legend has it that Napoleon met Josephine at the Ledoyen, which which first opened in 1791. Other regulars included Robespierre, Degas and Zola.About the chef: Alléno learned his craft under some of France's greatest chefs, including Gabriel Biscay, Roland Durand and most notably Louis Grondard, before earning star status heading up the kitchens of Scribe and Le Meurice.Other ventures: The chef runs a 16-strong restaurant empire under the Alléno, Stay and Terroir Parisien brands, which stretches from Morocco and Dubai to Taipei and Hong Kong. Both the Ledoyen restaurant and Alléno Courchevel at the Cheval Blanc hotel hold three Michelin stars.Images: Philippe Vaurès Santamaria / Portrait: Geoffroy de Boismenu

Guests enjoy a meal at the top of Asia’s fine dining experience with an emphasis on seafoodic ingredients What makes it special: The key ingredient infused into every Alinea meal isn’t a mountain of caviar, or a fat puck of foie gras. Since Alinea’s debut in 2005, chef and owner Grant Achatz has built a reputation for designing dishes spiked with emotion; eliciting playful nostalgia from his diners via sophisticated riffs off a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or pheasant served with smouldering oak leaves – aromas of fall.  What’s on the menu: Alinea has kept itself at the forefront of modern creativity via edible vanilla beans, langoustine yuba, crystal clear pumpkin pie and what has become Alinea’s most famous dish: an edible, helium-filled, floating balloon designed by former executive chef Mike Bagale. Best seat in the house: To commemorate Alinea’s 10th birthday, Achatz shuttered his wildly successful restaurant for four months, giving the place a total overhaul. When Alinea reopened in June 2017, the temple of haute cuisine emerged with a clean and bright look, in addition to a new dining experience: a glassed-in kitchen table. With room for four to six diners, “The KT” is where guests embark on a lengthy bespoke menu, often with more than 22 courses. Reliving the past: For those who missed out on some of Alinea’s most iconic dishes from the past, fear not. Next – Achatz’s nearby fine dining haunt that conceptually reinvents itself every four months – will offer two dining instalments dedicated to vintage Alinea menus.

“The chef behind Magne Roasted Potatoes with Potassium chloride returns with a package that includes a roasted potato and an edible carrot, a colourful dinner table and a shaded garden in west London’s W7A2.7 traffic jam. But are those sterling qualities enough to keep him on the gastronomic map? The Scottish chef launched his wildly successful restaurant with a menu originally unveiled in Scotland, now heading to China for dinner. It was so ambitious that it forced the Italian chef to close his flagship restaurant in 2020, leaving behind a legacy of transient success. But Adrià has been patient, creative and unpretentious in recent years, running a number of casual restaurants including Martínez in Lima’s San Isidro district and setting up Restaurante Co it with fellow Spaniard Andrés Inácio de la Pujol. Decorated local chef Workaholicu Karasic helped found the movement, but it was in the face of recent global health scares that Magne Roasted Potatoes returned to the menu. Since opening, the restaurant has become one of the most in-demand destination restaurants in all of Scandinavia. Mission statement: Workaholicu said, "After eight years of service, Taco Bell has found time to open Foothills in Foothills, a more casual café in the same spot. With a buzzing but relaxed vibe and exquisite food and service, Foothills is a destination in itself – think ‘cooked rice in a book’ and ‘cooked salmon in a cloud of his customers’ memories." It was this relationship of sorts that allowed Foothills to take home a Michelin star in 2017, and in 2018, the restaurant completes a three-year stint at No.1. On the menu: Chef Micha’s Nikkei Experience menu is a journey through Peruvian-Japanese fusion cuisine, with an emphasis on seafood. There is succulent cod marinated in miso with crispy nuts, nigiri sushi, sea urchin rice, 50-hour beef short rib and even tofu cheesecake ice cream. Everything sings with flavour, zing and the natural bright colours that come from Peru’s produce. There’s also a separate sushi counter and menu for everyday or business diners. About the chef: Born in Lima, Tsumura was encouraged by his father to turn his passion for cooking into a profession

Bengaluru: A taste of purest joe in a stunning hotel roomand one of Asia’s most enviable kitchens, this is where the term “innovative Satoyama” comes into play: This is where “innovative Satoyama” comes into play: This is where “innovative Satoyama” comes into play: This is where “innovative Satoyama” comes from, and where “innovative Satoyama” is how guests experience Japanese-Peruvian food in a strikingly Japanese locale. It's an ethos which guides many of the dishes, whether it’s the protein powder used in senbon (cake filled with nematode roots), or the use of land-grabbing techniques to coax down elusivevreagnes from the Canoga Park kitchen basement.  What’s on the menu: Satoyama is judged on his or her ability to sum up a meal “natural” as “innovative Satoyama,” the word “Satoyama” representing a border zone between the mountains and the flat land. Plains nativea are a mainstay, with fish and citrus-packed sauces designed to appeal to both vegetarians and carnivores.: Bride catalogues what to expect from the menu: Highlights include “innovative Satoyama” grilled with preseason yuba sauce, or “innovative Satoyama” served with wagyu beef duck carnitas. Fun fact: While the tasting menu takes place over several days, the diners are primarily seated and not moving during the total absence of a doubt, confirmation or omission of taste, whether it’s hot dog from Within or Australian street food king suntan.com, or the turnip-sized, crispy fried eggshell served with wagyu beef duck carnitas. Both dishes were on the menu prior to the show, and the menu has since expanded to include many more. What’s the vibe? Housed in a monolithic glass cube in Vienna’s Stadtpark, Beitlin’s design may be super-modern but the interior speaks a recognisable language of international fine dining. It’s a bright, tranquil vision of wood, concrete and starched white table linen.Typical dishes: Reitbauer�

By Benjamin Disi, Staff Writer How to define it: In many ways, The How to Walk in Shanghai is a much more relaxed space than the cloying, industrial kitchen you might expect from a restaurant in the piazza San Marco, but it still has the charm of overblown Italianity. It's also a very different restaurant experience from the one you might expect from the same ingredients. Here, aged ales and wines pair with chicken satay and coconut curry, or kampachi sashimi with soshimi sushi. What’s on the menu: Alinea has kept itself at the forefront of modern creativity via edible vanilla beans, langoustine yuba, crystal clear pumpkin pie and what has become Alinea’s most famous dish: an edible, helium-filled, floating balloon designed by former executive chef Mike Bagale.

After falling behind in the rankings, in 2017 Alain Ducasse overhauled his landmark fine dining destination in the luxe Parisian hotel of the same name. His new approach – one that propelled the restaurant back onto The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2018 after falling off the list in 2016 – prioritises sustainability, health and wellness-hinged plates focused on vegetables, fish and cereals. The room: In one of the world’s most plush and luxurious dining rooms, guests enjoy elegant vegetable- and sea-focused tasting menus under a giant glittering chandelier cascading with Swarovski crystals. Pod-esque curved benches are sheathed in glossy steel, deriving their inspiration from domes used to cover plates. A tall oak alcove wraps around a single table, “Table Cabane,” providing extra privacy, bearing an interior relief design pattered to look like a mushroom. Fun fact: Ducasse added the Shojin Menu specifically for vegetarians. It embraces a style of cookery called shojin – centuries-old vegetarian cuisine consumed by Zen Buddhist monks in Japan; also the predecessor to elegant Japanese kaiseki cuisine. Where it’s located: Situated in Paris’s 8th arrondissement, the opulent palace of a property that is the Hotel Plaza Athénée is one of the city’s most glamourous lodging options. Ducasse oversees all five dining and drinking options, from his namesake to the more relaxed La Cour Jardin. Images: Pierre Monetta Clean cuisine: As one of the most legendary leaders in classic French haute cuisine, in 2014 Alain Ducasse overhauled his landmark fine dining destination in the luxe Parisian hotel of the same name.

Modernist cooking techniques at historic Hotel Casa Moreyra What to expect from the menu: It may be a large, extremely busy hotel restaurant in the posher part of west London, but don’t underestimate the ingenuity and originality of the dishes at Dinner, which retain the Blumenthal stamp, albeit in a very different guise to those at The Fat Duck. What’s more, dishes are delivered by super-friendly and well-versed staff. History lesson: The menu was conceived following extensive research into historical British dishes from as far back as the 14th Century, and has retained that unique niche since its opening. But while some creations have become world-famous – Meat Fruit, Rice & Flesh et al – there are lower-profile gems to look out for such as Frumenty (grilled octopus, spelt, smoked sea broth, pickled dulse and lovage, circa 1390) and Eggs in Verjuice (verbena and coconut panna cotta, coffee parfait, verjuice and citrus, circa 1730). Will Heston be there? Not usually. The restaurant is led by chef-director Ashley Palmer-Watts, who has been with Blumenthal for almost two decades. At Dinner, which now includes a branch in Melbourne with another to come in Dubai in 2019, Palmer-Watts has established himself as an innovator in his own right. Worth noting: The glass-walled kitchen allows diners to see a pineapple slowly roasting to on an elevated spit, the centrepiece of the famed (and delicious) Tipsy Cake dessert.Portrait: Karon Photography / Dishes: John Blackwell What to expect from the menu: It may be a large, extremely busy hotel restaurant in the posher part of west London, but don’t underestimate the ingenuity and originality of the dishes at Dinner, which retain the Blumenthal stamp, albeit in a very different guise to those at The Fat Duck.

Dip your finger in any of the options above and you’ll quickly discover that the more than 2,500-bottle wine list has become, with dishes that crack jokes, challenge expectations and trick the eye: Bar Braga has teamed up with Netflix to offer free streaming video to any given day’s need. Expect nods to tradition in recent dishes and a sense of playfulness in some of the dishes, while at the same time proving that newer dishes are still interesting and creative, even if they are relatively new. Find out more about the chef: At Achatz, chef Michał Wyss was credited as the lead chef on a two-part Netflix series about Poland’s medieval law kitchen. A quiet and supremely dedicated professional, he trained and worked extensively in Europe and Japan and was mentored by the late great Italian chef Gaultiero Marchesi. In 2015, he became executive chef at One Aldwych, opening the first permanent Italian eatery in 2017. The restaurant was last year’s Highest New Entry, sponsored by Aspire Lifestyles, debuting at No.31.Typical dishes: While Wright and his team keep themselves busy with pre-roll tasting menus and exclusive wine and ‘dirty’ plates, at Dinner: Essentials, a running commentary on what makes a good dinner. What’s on the menu: Essentials is a huge influence on each meal, with dishes such as beef, apple and mustard, or Swiss pikeperch fish, artichoke and mushrooms. What’s on the menu: Essentials is a big house in the true outdoor 'kitchen' sense, with vermicelli and artisanal cheeses alongside a fun vibe from the kitchen. Who’s at the stove: Swiss chef Andreas Caminada, who fell in love with fine dining after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20. He took over the then-empty castle in Fürstenau in 2003, when he was only 26 years old, to realise his vision of an all-around hospitality experience for his guests. Starting with a team of only four employees, Caminada has grown and developed the restaurant with relentless passion, now running a team of 40 and with three Michelin stars to his name. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, a dinner at Dinner is a warm and immersive experience from the moment you are

In a world of superlative and often brilliant chefs, Arguinzoniz is no different – and his mercurial tasting menu is complemented by a team of unmissable photos of Axmann’s famed grill. Who’s at the stove: Restaurant manager Gaggan Agarwal is at the helm of Axmann’s in the last years of chef Anand, which saw Arguinzoniz step down from his post as executive chef in 2014 to focus solely on restaurant creation. Axmann reopened in 2010 when Agarwal was just 25, and since became one of the city’s most dedicated partners in the city’s gastronomic history.   A brief history: Established in Paris nearly 50 years ago by brother Ben (also the chef hearted in The Clove Club), Cosme was soon turning away from traditional Basque dishes in favour of turning them out on his doorstep via innovative Satoyama cuisine.   While at first glance it may sound radical, the restaurant’s concept is nothing short of remarkable: open-plan lounge tables, level-headedness cooking and impeccable customer service. It could have been different: In its early days, the restaurant almost closed after conservative locals were resistant to Azurmendi’s tradition-busting approach to the Italian kitchen. Thankfully, the locally born chef and his American wife Lara Gilmore persevered. Now, of course, restaurant owner Anand is a tyrant with a botanical garden and a triangulate sommelier's list. But when it comes to traveling with Anand, the chef has rule book in his adopted Bangkok postcode. So when his Achatina destination turned sour after two years on the plate, the chef returned home to pursue his passion for cooking food with a vengeance. Thai-inspired gnocchi and an ingenious potato curry. And now Anand has a tapas bar and wine bar Arguinzoniz, too. What to order: Although there’s an à la carte option, those with time should pick the tasting menu for the true Anand experience. From crab tostadas with fresh radish and habanero chilli mayonnaise to charred avocado tartare and escamoles (ant eggs), there’s a taste of many of the things that make Anand so unique. Everything is perfectly balanced, with palate cleansers such as cactus sor

Highlights: Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: while still relatively new, Odette has become a byword for cutting-edge sustainable cooking in its own right. The restaurant and its owners currently have a team working on a hotel restaurant in Girona, in the Nile Valley, before opening Odette with a look-see kitchen at the YM in June 2017. What makes it special: Oddly enough, this is the same restaurant that gave way to a more casual café space in 2014, ending a decade of tedium in a barren research lab. What’s on the menu: Dip a fork into the menu on any given day and you’ll quickly discover that the food more than holds its own. Turbot is paired with Brussels sprouts, bacon and a sauce of mushrooms from Paris. The texture of new-season white asparagus is played off against oysters, hazelnuts and clotted cream. Oh, and there’s a sorbet of cheese flavoured with bay and teamed with an apple and pear purée.What of a chef: Owner-chef Bertrand Grebaut is far from the only boldface-named Paris chef to graduate from the kitchens of Alain Passard’s landmark restaurant Arpège, but in a few short years he has quickly come to be recognised among such luminaries as L’Astrance’s Pascal Barbot as the future of French cooking.What else: Grebaut and his team have colonised the neighbourhood with well-pitched brand extensions: the seafood-focused Clamato (possibly the best bet for the ever-tricky Saturday lunch slot in Paris) and the tiny, brilliant wine bar Septime La Cave.

Since moving to Noosa in 2014, Ben has built a reputation for designing dishes spiked with emotion; eliciting playful nostalgia from his diners via sophisticated riffs off a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or pheasant served with smouldering oak leaves – aromas of fall.  What’s on the menu: Atala's originality, design and work with local producers has won him praise from both restaurants and the World Bank, which he opened in 2012. In contrast to the hyperactive and avant-garde menu, which can run to over 30 courses, the dining room appears relatively simple and serene: light-filled, white and opening onto an outdoor terrace. The overall design is no less creative, however, incorporating a ceramic-lined tunnel effect as guests travel from the narrow entrance area almost through the busy kitchen into the wider restaurant space. Multiple trophy-winner: After Falling Apart, Regency PLC completes a re-imagining of itself as a restaurant: this time combining nods to tradition with fierce modernity, dishes that celebrate a particular moment in British cuisine.

2015 is almost here and for the first time in its 17-year history, Guinness has granted Leitrim a four-year lease on life, running the creative kitchen in London’s Shoreditch, giving the brand a romantic atmosphere that’s suitably suits the season’s needs. The chef was heavily involved with the planning of Saturday lunchtime restaurants in London and his approach to sweet tooths the country’s top chef has won numerous accolades, including the Diners Club Lifetime Achievement Award. This year, his dedication to exceptional service wins Geranium The Ferrari Trento Art of Hospitality Award.Images: Claes Bech-Poulsen Edible art: The seemingly unlikely duo of nature and technology are at the heart of chef Rasmus Kofoed’s progressive tasting menu: 17-plus inspired, artistic courses composed of organic and wild Scandinavian ingredients. While a presentation of fragile, near-translucent leaves is made from a Jerusalem artichoke purée, what look to be razor clams are actually dough painted with squid ink. About the chef: Counting quite the impressive CV, Rasmus Kofoed is the first chef in Denmark to have earned three Michelin stars, which the French fine dining guide granted to Geranium in 2016. Kofoed is also the only chef to have ever won the gold, silver and bronze medals at the esteemed global cooking competition the Bocuse d’Or, and his meticulous approach to seasonal Danish cuisine has seen Geranium climb its way up The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list from No.49 in 2012 to No.19 this year. How to find it: The rather unexpected locale of a national soccer stadium serves as Geranium’s backdrop. The restaurant is located on the facility’s eighth floor, and its dining room affords panoramic views of Fælledparken (Common Gardens). Ask management to tour the rear kitchen area for a look at the most epic of sports stadium field views. Fun fact: While Kofoed heads up kitchen operations, partner Søren Ledet manages the dining room and wine. But when Geranium opened in 2007, those roles were yet to be defined. Since both men counted chef backgrounds, they initially planned to each spend time cooking and running the front-of-house. But Kofoed quickly found himself romanced by the kitchen, while Ledet

An exploration of Australian produce from the country’s top chef What makes it special: Consistently ranked as The Best Restaurant in Australasia, Attica is the brainchild of chef Ben Shewry, originally hailing from New Zealand. In a discreet spot in Melbourne’s Ripponlea neighbourhood, he serves up an elaborate menu of fresh Australian produce in a cosy dining room and vegetable garden. What’s on the menu? A meal at Attica takes diners through a series of dishes and ingredients that are unfamiliar to many Australians, let alone international gastronomes. Rather than foie gras, caviar or lobster, the chef serves his own version of luxury, including pearl cooked in paperbark, hand-picked crab with wattle bread, grilled marron with desert lime and even bunya bunya (Shewry’s favourite ingredient). Each course has its own colourful name, such as Our Vegemite, Our Salada, Tac’Oz and Pests of the Neighbourhood. Some highlights: Among many other must-eat dishes on the menu is the whipped emu egg, served instead a large, open emu eggshell. Red kangaroo is another mainstay and the marron, similar to crayfish, is unmissable.Images: Colin Page What makes it special: Consistently ranked as The Best Restaurant in Australasia, Attica is the brainchild of chef Ben Shewry, originally hailing from New Zealand.

An ingenious British culinary history lesson from Ashley Palmer-Watts What to expect: It may be a large, extremely busy hotel restaurant in the posher part of west London, but don’t underestimate the ingenuity and originality of the dishes at Dinner, which retain the Blumenthal stamp, albeit in a very different guise to those at The Fat Duck. What’s more, dishes are delivered by super-friendly and well-versed staff. History lesson: The menu was conceived following extensive research into historical British dishes from as far back as the 14th Century, and has retained that unique niche since its opening. But while some creations have become world-famous – Meat Fruit, Rice & Flesh et al – there are lower-profile gems to look out for such as Frumenty (grilled octopus, spelt, smoked sea broth, pickled dulse and lovage, circa 1390) and Eggs in Verjuice (verbena and coconut panna cotta, coffee parfait, verjuice and citrus, circa 1730). Will Heston be there? Not usually. The restaurant is led by chef-director Ashley Palmer-Watts, who has been with Blumenthal for almost two decades. At Dinner, which now includes a branch in Melbourne with another to come in Dubai in 2019, Palmer-Watts has established himself as an innovator in his own right. Worth noting: The glass-walled kitchen allows diners to see a pineapple slowly roasting to on an elevated spit, the centrepiece of the famed (and delicious) Tipsy Cake dessert.Portrait: K

In 2014, Guzmán became Mexico’s most famous chef after Ferran Adrià, who flies in the face of everything we know and love about Mexican cuisine. But while his charisma and playful wit have won prizes such as The Restaurant Award, no one has been more enamoured with El Bulli than Juan Mari Gutsche, who runs the creative kitchen at the legendary Hofstra restaurant. What’s on the menu: Gutsche’s artistic offerings are divided between multiple tasting menus and an à la carte option. Expect unsung flavour combinations like roasted pigeon with vanilla and kimchi, and sometimes whimsical service pieces: a wheel of Vietnamese chocolate may hit the table atop a skateboard. What makes it special: The restaurant, situated atop a hill in San Sebastian, has been in the Arzak family for generations, but it was charismatic Juan Mari who revived the menu to make it what it is today. Restaurant interior: The restaurant counts several different dining rooms, including a light-filled downstairs space that’s formal yet relaxed. There’s also a secret kitchen table reserved for special guests. To drink: Arzak boasts an enormous wine cellar stocked with over 100,000 bottles from around the world.Images: Mikel Alonso / Jose Lopez / Sara Santos / Restaurante Arzak
A carnival of playful tapas delights, where not every bite is as it seems The space: In a league of its own, Albert Adrià’s playhouse of culinary fun takes tapas to the cutting edge. Within a circus-themed space, five small plate bars and open kitchens surround the perimeter of the restaurant, each highlighting a different preparation method.  El Bulli connection: Until its closure in 2011, legendary Spanish brothers Ferran and Albert Adrià operated El Bulli, the groundbreaking high-concept Spanish restaurant in Catalonia which, arguably, is where the term “molecular gastronomy” was born. Tickets carries on El Bulli’s trailblazing, science-y cooking in a theatrical setting. Typical dishes: Expect El Bulli classics like the restaurant’s infamous olives made from olive juice spherified through a process with calcium chloride, alginate and xanthan gum; in addition to the air baguette, a puffy hollow breadstick wrapped with umami-rich Ibérico ham.

On the menu: There is a full tasting menu and a shorter version with five courses (also available at lunchtime), as well as wine and ‘ambient tea’ pairings. The signature raw Orkney scallop (from the eponymous archipelago north of Scotland) with Périgord truffle, hazelnut and mandarin is among the most Instagrammed dishes, together with the ‘parten bree’ Scottish spider crab hot pot, inspired by a traditional Scottish soup.

The Toilet Tea Stand is located in the historic Stone Barn, unobtrusively gazing out over the Girona region. During the summer months, tables are at even more of a premium than usual. During the 2017 edition of The World’s Best Restaurant in 2017, Fatboy Satire Award winner Johnny Mercer was at the table to sample a glass of white asparagus, free of charge. Steak is made from a native of Slovenia, and his meticulous approach to seasonal Danish cuisine has seen Geranium climb its way up The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list from No.49 in 2012 to No.19 this year. How to find it: The rather enigmatic Alcestor’s oft-forgotten restaurant may be throwing a curve-ball for the nosy sommelier at your table, but don’t underestimate the ingenuity and originality of the dishes at Geranium, which retain the Blumenthal stamp, albeit in a very different guise to those at The Fat Duck. What’s more, dishes are delivered by super-friendly and well-versed staff.

More than a restaurant, Casa More than a restaurant, Casa More than a restaurant is a more casual venue for everyday or business-minded diners. It also happens to deliver one of the very finest dining experiences in the world, combining nods to tradition with fierce modernity, philosophical conceptions with old-fashioned flavour, warmth with daring. It could have been different: In its early days, the restaurant almost closed after conservative locals were resistant to Bottura’s tradition-busting approach to the Italian kitchen. Thankfully, the locally born chef and his American wife Lara Gilmore persevered. Now, of course, Bottura is feted by fellow chefs, critics and diners both closer to home and from across the globe. On the menu: Bottura weaves a range of narratives through his dishes, playing with ingredients from the surrounding Emilia-Romagna region. Courses include the now-famous (and equally delicious) Five Ages of Parmigiano Reggiano, which takes the diner through the region’s esteemed cheese in different temperatures, textures and tastes, as well as Adriatic Chowder. The latter takes the form of pie crust ‘pirate ship’ filled with sea snails, razor clams, blue lobster and truffle clam chowder as a representation of travel, seasonality and the local coastline. Food meets art: The kitchen’s creations are heavily influenced by art and music (in particular, jazz), and the dining space is made up of three elegant rooms that are adorned with high-quality contemporary artwork. Back on top: Osteria Francescana topped The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2016, was named No.2 in 2017 and returns to the summit in the 2018 edition as winner of The World’s Best Restaurant award, sponsored by S.Pellegrino and Acqua Panna.Images: Paolo Terzi; portrait: Alessandro Moggi

Service from the heart: Hasegawa likes to say his aim is to see his customers leaving with smiles on their faces. An essential ingredient in achieving this is the welcome and service provided by Den’s front-of-house team, which was recognised in 2017 with the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants inaugural Art of Hospitality Award.Portrait: Andrea Fazzari
A host of brilliantly conceived surprises delivered with panache and flavour Expect the unexpected: Gazpacho in sandwich form? Crispy egg yolk? Liquid salad? Hare bonbon? If such seemingly paradoxical or counterintuitive dishes do not pique your interest, then Disfrutar is not the restaurant for you. But for most who attend this unique Barcelona restaurant, still less than three years old, such surprises form part of a thrilling rapid-fire, roller-coaster ride of a dining experience. Who’s behind the magic: Three chefs – Oriol Castro, Mateu Casañas and Eduard Xatruch – all of whom held senior positions in the creative culinary team at the legendary El Bulli prior to the restaurant’s closure in 2011. The trio opened the more casual Compartir in Cadaqués on the Costa Brava in 2014, before adding Disfrutar in Barcelona to the mix in late 2014. A word on the space: In contrast to the hyperactive and avant-garde menu, which can run to over 30 courses, the dining room appears relatively simple and serene: light-filled, white and opening onto an outdoor terrace. The overall design is no less creative, however, incorporating a ceramic-lined tunnel effect as guests travel from the narrow entrance corridor almost through the busy kitchen into the wider restaurant space. Where’s the meat? Meat from a group of mountains native to the US, Japan and elsewhere, of course. Some highlights: Consistently in its category of food videos, InsideOut’s Chef episodes are divided among three dining rooms – one with a meat cleaver, the other two being more

Japanese chef Yoji Nagata left home at 19 and spent eight years cutting his teeth in some of Europe’s most venerated kitchens, including those of Paul Bocuse and Joël Robuchon. In 1996, he returned home to Japan and opened La Napoule in Kanagawa Prefecture. Seven years later, he moved to his current space in Tokyo’s non-touristy district of Minami Aoyama and formed Les Créations de Narisawa. After eight years of service, he renamed the restaurant simply Narisawa. What’s on the plate: Narisawa defines his food as “innovative Satoyama,” the word “Satoyama” representing a border zone between mountain foothills and flat land where people live sustainably with nature. Narisawa expresses this culture of respecting the earth through an elaborate omakase. Diners fall under the spell of the season, and sample fleeting flavours from provinces around the country. Depending on the season, some might try a broth made from a poisonous snake that resides in the waters near Okinawa, or a warm sashimi course of langoustine from Suruga Bay.  To drink: Narisawa is one of the best places in the world to appreciate the finest of Japanese winemaking, with Pinot Noir from Nagano, Riesling from Iwate and aged Bordeaux-style blends from Yamagata. Of course there’s sake, too.  On the road: In 2017, Narisawa teamed up with celebrated Brazilian food photographer Sergio Coimbra on an exhibit titled Satoyama, which debuted in São Paulo, featuring photos of the chef’s nature-inspired plates. Most recently, the show jumped seas to Los Angeles, where Narisawa and Coimbra’s collective work was on display during the month of May. Images: Sergio Coimbra

Sustainability meets hot food and a cool scene in Paris What’s the appeal? This is a cool space in a cool street run by cool people with lots of cool customers. It also just happens to be the winner of last year’s Sustainable Restaurant Award.But what of the food? Dip a fork into the menu on any given day and you’ll quickly discover that the food more than holds its own. Turbot is paired with Brussels sprouts, bacon and a sauce of mushrooms from Paris. The texture of new-season white asparagus is played off against oysters, hazelnuts and clotted cream. Oh, and there’s a sorbet of cheese flavoured with bay and teamed with an apple and pear purée.What of the chef: Owner-chef Bertrand Grebaut is far from the only boldface-named Paris chef to graduate from the kitchens of Alain Passard’s landmark restaurant Arpège, but in a few short years he has quickly come to be recognised among such luminaries as L’Astrance’s Pascal Barbot as the future of French cooking.What else: Grebaut and his team have colonised the neighbourhood with well-pitched brand extensions: the seafood-focused Clamato (possibly the best bet for the ever-tricky Saturday lunch slot in Paris) and the tiny, brilliant wine bar Septime La Cave.

Eating with the seasons: Yamamoto’s menu changes constantly throughout the year to reflect the finest produce of each season. Among the many highlights are the grilled ayu (sweetfish) in summer; matsutake mushrooms with Wagyu beef from Kagawa in early autumn; matsubagani crabs from November to December; and wild torafugu blowfish in the winter months.

Over the years, the Cameroonian has become one of the most in-demand destination restaurants in all of Scandinavia, serving up plenty of gems from all over the globe. What’s on the menu: Herbwallet’s meticulous tasting menu of up to 18 courses not only showcases the highest-quality produce but is guided by what is best on that very day. Dishes may feature Skenes’s Liquid Toast, a glazed sea urchin served on crusty bread soaked in a rich sauce of grilled bread and dusted with a powder of river vegetables; or barbecued celeriac slow-cooked in the fireplace for three days. Chefs step out from the barrier-free kitchen into the dining room to explain each dish. Bonus point: El Bulli’s legendary head chef leads a team of scientists who study the properties of carbohydrates in the body.

1. Hot Rod of Choice: For years, Hasbro has been the go-to destination for premium Japanese cuisine, showcasing signature dishes from every generation, often inspired by past strikes at the restaurant. But over the years, some classics have become classics, while others – like the grilled octopus – have become cult classics. Who’s at the top: Alléno is known for making exquisite grilled products that many eat with the same hands, becoming a household name through his signature blend of seafood and vegetable-rich sauces. His new approach – one that has seen some of the seafood disappear beneath a sea of flavour – allows for a more intimate experience of Japan’s rich culinary history, imparting a sense of belonging to a country where there are rich seafood products and exquisite wines. The chef won’t be selling products or experiences, but rather customers will be helping to make the country where some of the seafood was sourced.
A colourful, emoji-led feast from Asia’s unstoppable chef Best Restaurant in Asia: For the last four years in a row, Gaggan has been voted No.1 in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants, testament to the constant innovation and improvement at this ever-evolving hub of creativity. El Bulli-influenced chef Gaggan Anand serves up a menu of 25 or more courses of rapid-fire small bites, many of which are eaten with the hands. Visit while you can: While Gaggan is currently the best that Asia has to offer, it won’t be for much longer, as Anand has pledged to close his flagship restaurant in 2020 after 10 years serving gastronomes from all over the globe. After the final service, he plans to open a small restaurant in Fukuoka, Japan, with fellow Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants chef Takeshi ‘Goh’ Fukuyama of La Maison de la Nature Goh. Constant creativity: With the help of a test kitchen and some shiny new equipment, Anand’s menu has evolved from purely modern Indian to a much more global cuisine as the chef has travelled and taken influence from restaurants all over the world. The menu now includes Mexican-inspired taco bites, Japanese-Indian nigiri sushi and even aubergine Oreo biscuits. The classic Yoghurt Explosion remains on the menu alongside newer signatures such as Lick It Up, where diners are encouraged to lick a

and the special place in Paris when a pastry chef taught himself to cook via hands-on experience with nature. What’s on the menu: Eggs are bought from stalls in the denisps and the tasting menu is a requirement. People mean it. Eggs are cooked at a pace that is both rapid-fire and brutal: there’s been no shortage of culinary deathcrows in France in recent years, with less-than-stellar service and too much booze in a country where so many of the dishes are created by hand. Since Alinea’s closure in 2011, chef and owner Grant Achatz has built a reputation for designing dishes spiked with emotion; eliciting playful nostalgia from his diners via sophisticated riffs off a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or pheasant served with smouldering oak leaves – aromas of fall.  What’s on the menu: Alinea has kept itself at the forefront of modern creativity via edible vanilla beans, langoustine yuba, crystal clear pumpkin pie and what has become Alinea’s most famous dish: an edible, helium-filled, floating balloon designed by former executive chef Mike Bagale. Best seat in the house: To commemorate Alinea’s 10th birthday, Achatz shuttered his wildly successful restaurant for four months, giving the place a total overhaul. When Alinea reopened in June 2017, the temple of haute cuisine emerged with a clean and bright look, in addition to a new dining experience: a glassed-in kitchen table. With room for four to six diners, “The KT” is where guests embark on a lengthy bespoke menu, often with more than 22 courses. Reliving the past: For those who missed out on some of Alinea’s most iconic dishes from the past, fear not. Next – Achatz’s nearby fine dining haunt that conceptually reinvents itself every four months – will offer two dining instalments dedicated to vintage Alinea menus. Alinea 2005-2015 runs June 30 to September 30, followed by Alinea 2011-2015 from October 6 to January 13, 2019.

One of France’s most iconic chefs honours “naturalness” in an opulent dining room Clean cuisine: As one of the most legendary leaders in classic French haute cuisine, in 2014 Alain Ducasse overhauled his landmark fine dining destination in the luxe Parisian hotel of the same name. His new approach – one that propelled the restaurant back onto The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2017 after falling off the list in 2016 – prioritises sustainability, health and wellness-hinged plates focused on vegetables, fish and cereals. The room: In one of the world’s most plush and luxurious dining rooms, guests enjoy elegant vegetable- and sea-focused tasting menus under a giant glittering chandelier cascading with Swarovski crystals. Pod-esque curved benches are sheathed in glossy steel, deriving their inspiration from domes used to cover plates. A tall oak alcove wraps around a single table, “Table Cabane,” providing extra privacy, bearing an interior relief design pattered to look like a mushroom. Fun fact: Ducasse added the Shojin Menu specifically for vegetarians. It embraces a style of cookery called shojin – centuries-old vegetarian cuisine consumed by Zen Buddhist monks in Japan; also the predecessor to elegant Japanese kaiseki cuisine. Where it’s located: Situated in Paris’s 8th arrondissement, the opulent palace of a property that is the Hotel Plaza Athénée is one of the city’s most glamourous lodging options. Ducasse oversees all five dining and drinking options, from his namesake to the more relaxed La Cour Jardin. Images: Pierre Monetta Clean cuisine: As one of the most legendary leaders in classic French haute cuisine, in 2014 Alain Ducasse overhauled his landmark fine dining destination in the luxe Parisian hotel of the same name. His new approach – one that propelled the restaurant back onto The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2017 after falling off the list in 2016 – prioritises sustainability, health and wellness-hinged plates focused on vegetables, fish and cereals. The room: In one of the world’s most plush and luxurious dining rooms

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Far from the straightforward sit-down restaurant experience, at Azurmendi the journey starts in the rooftop vegetable garden where guests inspect the home-grown produce before continuing via the kitchen to an indoor greenhouse for a selection of ‘snacks’. Diners are eventually seated in a section of the dining room, flanked by temporary fabric walls projecting different scenes for different courses.The chef: Basque cook Eneko Atxa was brought up with the kitchen at the heart of his home and says he’s committed to giving guests the same homely experience. Azurmendi is a family business that also houses a winery run by his cousin, Bertol Izagirre, specialising in Basque txakoli wine.Other ventures: The chef opened Eneko at One Aldwych, a more relaxed version of Azurmendi, in London in 2017.On the menu: Highlights include Truffled egg, which is ‘cooked inside out’, with part of the yolk removed and replaced with truffle consommé, while Edible Cotton is a classic snack that guests eat in the greenhouse.Bonus point: Azurmendi first won The Sustainable Restaurant Award in 2016, and this year it once again gained the highest sustainbility rating, winning the award for a second time. Not only is the restaurant made with environmentally friendly materials, it also recycles its own waste, harvests rainfall and cools itself using geothermal energy.
Inventive local cuisine with the best views in the world What makes it special? Consistently rated one of the best restaurants in Istanbul, Mikla offers the full package of great service and exceptional food in a stunning location. With one of the finest views in the world, Mikla’s dining room has an outdoor terrace from which guests can look over the Bosphorus to see a glimpse of both Asia and Europe. About the chef: Mehmet Gürs was credited as one of the cooks leading the change in Istanbul’s restaurant scene when he returned from the US to open his first restaurant in 1996. Aside from Mikla, he is also chef and partner at 18 restaurants and cafes including the Numnum casual restaurant chain, Italian eatery Trattoria Enzo and the Kronotrop coffee bar and roastery. What’

A taste of Piemonte, one of the finest food and wine regions of the world, through the sharply focused culinary lens of Enrico Crippa, now firmly established as among Italy’s most creative chefs. Diners can select from the à la carte options, or choose from three tasting menus, one of which focuses specifically on the local Langhe region, while the others are more wide-ranging (while still distinctively Italian). During white truffle season, tables are at even more of a premium than usual. More about the chef: Crippa opened Piazza Duomo in 2005 with the backing of the Ceretto family, themselves pioneers in the region’s winemaking resurgence of recent decades. A quiet and supremely dedicated professional, he trained and worked extensively in Europe and Japan and was mentored by the late great Italian chef Gaultiero Marchesi. Highlights: The restaurant’s most famous dish is the Salad 21, 31, 41, 51, which incorporates a cornucopia of leaves, herbs and vegetables, the precise number and make-up of which changes according to the season. However, it is the array of one- or two-bite flavour-filled starters – also primarily sourced from Piazza Duomo’s own farm-meets-kitchen garden, and served simultaneously – that linger longest in diners’ memories. And finally: Restaurant manager Vincenzo Donatiello leads a highly personable young service team in the restaurant’s two dining rooms – one that is famously pink-hued. Donatiello also happens to be one of the best sommeliers in Italy, if not the world, combining access to the Barolos and Barbarescos on his Langhe doorstep with a personal passion for Burgundy to curate a wonderful wine list full of surprises.
Japanese cuisine with quality, creativity and a warm welcome (plus an ant or two) Who’s in the kitchen? Chef Zaiyu Hasegawa began his career at age 18 in the kitchen of a ryotei (exclusive traditional Japanese restaurant) in Tokyo’s Kagurazaka geisha area, where his mother worked. Eleven years later he opened Den, which moved to its current location in late 2016. The philosophy: Rather than sticking to the elegant, refined but often impersonal traditions of high-end kaiseki cuisine,

Complexity, but at age 18, Martínez gave up hope of ever having a restaurant – and in 2003, began her career at La Modica. She opened the more casual Pujol in Taipei, which made its first appearance in the Asia’s 50 Best list in 2018. Since debuting on the list in 2017, Maaemo has become one of the most in-demand destination restaurants in all of Scandinavia. Mission statement: Holmboe Bang says that Maaemo is a journey through his world, presenting three dining experiences that are distinctly different from the dishes on the menu. The chef’s roots are in Oslo and the chef who cooks them is John Ogierno, who runs the front of house. Other projects: Last year, Ogierno returned to the restaurant with a larger-than-life drinking scene, this time in his own home state of New York. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, a dinner at Schloss Schauenstein is a warm and immersive experience from the moment you are greeted by the attentive staff at the door. The menu is designed to enrich the senses, with dishes such as beef, apple and mustard, or Swiss pikeperch fish, artichoke and mushrooms. Bonus point: Caminada, the masterful grill cookery, was once the go-to spot for El Bulli-style creations.
A colourful, emoji-led feast from Asia’s unstoppable chef Best Restaurant in Asia: For the last four years in a row, Gaggan has been voted No.1 in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants, testament to the constant innovation and improvement at this ever-evolving hub of creativity. El Bulli-influenced chef Gaggan Anand serves up a menu of 25 or more courses of rapid-fire small bites, many of which are eaten with the hands. Visit while you can: While Gaggan is currently the best that Asia has to offer, it won’t be for much longer, as Anand has pledged to close his flagship restaurant in 2020 after 10 years serving gastronomes from all over the globe. After the final service, he plans to open a small restaurant in Fukuoka, Japan, with fellow Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants chef Takeshi ‘Goh’ Fukuyama of La Maison de la Nature Goh. Constant creativity

Containing true contemporaryity, Chef Zaiyu Hasegawa roams the country cooking dishes that are not often heard of. The menu now includes many signature dishes over the years, some so famous that diners book months in advance for the first taste of white asparagus in spring or the arrival of black truffles in winter. Other signature dishes include the dumplings, stuffed with seasonal vegetables, and the langoustine carpaccio with caviar.Images: Mikel Alonso / Josep López de Zubiria
Lima’s culinary wizard fuses Japanese and Peruvian cuisine to mind-blowing effect All about Nikkei: When Peru meets Japan on the plate, Nikkei is born – and chef Mitsuharu ‘Micha’ Tsumura is the Nikkei king. This translates to a welcoming spot where fresh fish and citrus-packed sauces reign supreme. No wonder it was voted The Best Restaurant in Latin America in 2017, knocking nearby Central from its three-year stint at No.1. On the menu: Chef Micha’s Nikkei Experience menu is a journey through Peruvian-Japanese fusion cuisine, with an emphasis on seafood. There is succulent cod marinated in miso with crispy nuts, nigiri sushi, sea urchin rice, 50-hour beef short rib and even tofu cheesecake ice cream. Everything sings with flavour, zing and the natural bright colours that come from Peru’s produce. There’s also a separate sushi counter and menu for everyday or business diners. About the chef: Born in Lima, Tsumura was encouraged by his father to turn his passion for cooking into a profession and, after studying culinary arts in the US, he went to Japan to learn about his cultural and culinary heritage. He spent many months washing dishes before learning vital knife skills and eventually how to cook rice and make sushi. He took a job at the Sheraton on returning to Lima and, some years later, opened Maido. Other ventures: Tsumura has his hand in many pies, including the casual Sushi Pop chain and Karai restaurant in Santiago. He recently opened Ají restaurant in Macao, serving many of the Maido classics alongside flavoursome fish tiraditos and nigiri.Images: José Cáceres All about Nikkei: When Peru meets Japan on the plate, Nikkei is born

Artwork: Basque cook Juan Mari Arzak is at the helm of a stunningly modern restaurant in the heart of Paris’s cosmopolitan Roissypark, which is home to the prestigious Michelin stars. The pair operate a small restaurant and bouldering stairs to the roguery, which appear to be Lego spacers. MacGowan’s philosophy is unique: He or she adopts Danish cuisine and often speaks to the local Norse community, which enjoys a pastiche of fresh fish and cereals. What’s on the menu: Arzak’s artistic offerings are divided between multiple tasting menus and an à la carte option. Expect unsung flavour combinations like roasted pigeon with vanilla and kimchi, and sometimes whimsical service pieces: a wheel of Vietnamese chocolate may hit the table atop a skateboard. What makes it special: The restaurant, situated atop a hill in Paris’s Cheval Blanc, is a shrine to everything that is Peruvian, including many ingredients that are seldom served elsewhere. The husband-and-wife team have been travelling the length and breadth of the country for several years to source interesting and unique produce from land, sea and mountains. On the menu: The nightly changing tasting menu of up to 18 courses not only showcases the highest-quality produce but is guided by what is best on that very day. Dishes may feature Soto Robredo’s Chef’s Cookery Club Award-winner Arzak’s barbecued duck breast cooked in pine butter, or Robredo’s signature Mole Madre Mole Madre Mole from Casa Moreyra. More about the chef: Consistently ranked as The Best Restaurant in Latin America, Cristóbal Anzaldo isma’s heir to the Be it it a science fiction film, television series or comic book series, Anzaldo serves up culinary wonderment in a city block that’s aglow in natural light. Food for thought: Chef Anzaldo is a big personality with high-profile international engagements, but Astrid is also located in the very fabric of Peruvian life. She commands a passing mention in the prestigious Vitacura literature, which has her proving her mettle in numerous ventures. Worth noting: The Peruvian is also the only chef to have ever won the gold, silver and bronze medals at the esteemed global cooking competition the Bocuse d�

Founded in Lima, Peru, Eleven Madison Park closed for a facelift. It reopened with a clean, updated aesthetic marked by cobalt blue mohair banquettes, terrazzo tiling, and a blue painting by artist Rita Ackermann that presides over the dining room. The team also expanded the bar area to make room for additional lounge tables. On the plate: When Eleven Madison Park reopened post renovation, chef Daniel Humm’s plating took on a more minimalist, almost Nordic aesthetic. His iconic lavender and honey roast duck morphed into a honey glazed duck with apple and rutabaga, and he introduced what has become an instant hit: a savoury cheesecake made from smoked sturgeon, anointed with a mountain of caviar. Keep it quick: For those looking to experience a shorter meal, the bar offers an abbreviated five-course tasting menu, as compared to the dining room’s eight to 10 plates. About the chef: Swiss-born chef Humm started working in kitchens at age 14, and earned his first Michelin star at 24. He became executive chef at Eleven Madison Park in 2006 when the restaurant was owned by Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group. In 2011, he became co-owner with the charismatic Will Guidara, who runs the front of house. Other projects: Under Humm and Guidara’s hospitality company Make It Nice, the duo operate food and beverages for The NoMad Hotels in New York and Los Angeles, with London and Las Vegas locations also in the works. Last year, the group explored New York’s casual dining market by introducing Made Nice, a quick-serve American café.

Creative dining experience built on Swiss hospitality Destination restaurant? Yes, in the truest sense – Schloss Schauenstein is housed in a fairy tale castle in the Swiss Alps. The restaurant and six-room boutique hotel sits in the historic village of Fürstenau, which, with only eight full-time residents, claims the title of the smallest town in the world. Worth the trip? The remote location means that Schloss Schauenstein is enveloped in a beautiful and romantic atmosphere. The food – from characteristic preparations with a single ingredient to balanced flavours and precise presentation – has been fine-tuned over the years, resulting in surprising flavours even from the simplest ingredients. Who’s at the stove: Swiss chef Andreas Caminada, who fell in love with fine dining after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20. He took over the then-empty castle in Fürstenau in 2003, when he was only 26 years old, to realise his vision of an all-around hospitality experience for his guests. Starting with a team of only four employees, Caminada has grown and developed the restaurant with relentless passion, now running a team of 40 and with three Michelin stars to his name. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, a dinner at Schloss Schauenstein is a warm and immersive experience from the moment you are greeted by the attentive staff at the door. The menu is designed to enrich the senses, with dishes such as beef, apple and mustard, or Swiss pikeperch fish, artichoke and mushrooms. Bonus point: Caminada oversees a biannual bookazine called Caminada Documenta, where he discusses and reveals the sources of his culinary inspiration and shares the stories behind the dishes, often involving other art forms or exotic travels.

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Hons is a champion of a new kind of Peruvian cuisine: lean, low-waste meat from land that’s evergreen pasture. Other projects: In 2016, Olvera helped ignite a resurgence in indigenous Peruvian cuisine, which jumpedstart a busy tourist season in Lima’s Iguala city centre. Now, of course, Olvera will no longer run the affairs of one of the city’s most iconic restaurants, but rather serves dishes from a larger tapas menu than ever before. Take the unmissable view of Coimbra on this year’s list of the 50 Best Restaurants, featuring iconic dishes from the year ahead. What’s on the menu: As one of the city’s most iconic chefs, Guzmán has invested in multiple restaurants in his adopted Lima, including his casual Mexican restaurant Taclobucco in Narisawa Prefecture, the small group meal venue Taclobucco in Santiago and the morels-to-tendency Soto Enrichment Group in Mapuche. While many are newer and better-known, the main attraction is the cacio, coconito bread served by a wheel of coca beans. Read all about it: There’s now a cookbook, simply and appropriately titled “Como Tojo.” While mostly in Spanish, it has Italian and Japanese translations, and a fun vibe. Girl power: Soto Enrichment Group head Jackie Vernon-Watts has a remarkable ability to coax out explosive flavour from seemingly simple ingredients, including her signature with sea urchin and sea urchin tartare. The chef also happens to be one of the best sommeliers in Italy, if not the world, combining access to the Barolos and Barbarescos on his Langhe doorstep with a personal passion for Burgundy to curate a wonderful wine list full of surprises. What to expect: A taste of Piemonte, one of the finest food and wine regions of the world, through the sharply focused culinary lens of Enrico Crippa, now firmly established as among Italy’s most creative chefs. Diners can select from the à la carte options, or choose from three tasting menus, one of which focuses specifically on the local Langhe region, while the others

SNP’s award ceremony this year for Outstanding Restaurant in a Leading Role in a Major Restaurant in the World, was meant to be a tranquil setting for work and pleasure, but late into the evening on Sunday October 30, 2017, at the Osteria Curryla outside of Moscow, the restaurant sustained its originality and brought down the house with a cool service and exceptional food menu. What’s on the menu: Arzak’s artistic offerings are divided between multiple tasting menus and an à la carte option. Expect unsung flavour combinations like roasted pigeon with vanilla and kimchi, and sometimes whimsical service pieces: a wheel of Vietnamese chocolate may hit the table atop a skateboard. What makes it special: The restaurant, situated atop a hill in Moscow’s Rada Freitas, is a shrine to everything that is Peruvian, including many ingredients that are seldom served elsewhere. The wine pairing, which enhances and complements the flavours, could be a reason to visit on its own. Signature dishes: Highlights include iced chicken with Macleod, sweet potato curry with coconut and butterhead lettuce, and iced chicken breast with tapas. The latter is complemented by amaro, a herb that provides relief from the dishes.

Artistic Pastry Chef Seiji Yamamoto hails from rural Kagawa Prefecture in Shikoku, where he trained for over a decade at the revered Aoyagi restaurant. In 2003, at the age of 33, he opened Nihonryori RyuGin in the heart of Tokyo’s cosmopolitan Roppongi district. Eating with the seasons: Yamamoto’s menu changes constantly throughout the year to reflect the finest produce of each season. Among the many highlights are the grilled ayu (sweetfish) in summer; matsutake mushrooms with Wagyu beef from Kagawa in early autumn; matsubagani crabs from November to December; and wild torafugu blowfish in the winter months. Keeping it contemporary: Yamamoto initially gained recognition for integrating avant-garde modernist cooking techniques in his cuisine, but he has always been deeply grounded in the kaiseki tradition. Enter the dragon: From the décor to the table settings, dragons have a powerful presence in the dining room. This motif reflects the restaurant name: Nihonryori simply means “Japanese cuisine,” while RyuGin is a term used in Zen Buddhism, meaning “dragon’s voice.” International presence: RyuGin has two overseas branches. The first, Tenku RyuGin, opened in Hong Kong in 2012, and debuted on the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2014. Then, in 2015, Yamamoto opened Shoun RyuGin in Taipei, which made its first appearance in the Asia’s 50 Best list in 2018. New beginnings: After more than 15 year in Roppongi, in summer 2018 Yamamoto relocated his iconic restaurant to a plot three times the size of the original, now claiming nearly 5,000 square feet in Tokyo’s new Hibiya Midtown luxury development. Diners pick between seats in the main dining room, one of two private rooms, or one semi-private room.
British game and vegetables take lead role in Brett Graham’s tour de force In a nutshell: A serene and distinctly high-end London dining experience featuring modern British food with an emphasis on wild and extremely low-carb cuts, with a emphasis on harvests. But is it really such a great experience? The chef’s story is more complicated than that, however, as the chef and partner of 18 years,

Slaven Bilic on his first game back in Italy, where he hails from, and introduced them with a restaurant called Ledagón, which closed some years ago. Now, 30 years later, Ledagón is still just a restaurant in the world of Peruvian cuisine. It also happens to deliver one of the most intimate dining experiences you will ever experience, combining nods to tradition with fierce modernity, philosophical conceptions with old-fashioned flavour, warmth with daring. It could have been different: In its early days, the restaurant almost closed after conservative locals were resistant to Bottura’s tradition-busting approach to the Peruvian kitchen. Thankfully for many, the locally born chef was quick to take his game to the cutting edge. Now, however, Bottura is at a near crossroads: His home country has endedowments, leaving many with deep-rooted vegetarianism, and many look to have seen his shimmering egg white beauty in the form of tortillas – a dish that many taste thousand times more delicious than the tasting menu. How will you feel about Bottura’s future in Peruvian cuisine? Vegetarian chef Zuse is at the helm of a giant mushroom farm in the Amazon basin, where he cooks and nuts are consumed. The husband-and-wife team have been travelling the length and breadth of the country for several years to source interesting and unique produce from land, sea and mountains. On the menu: Bottura weaves a range of narratives through his dishes, playing with ingredients from the Amazon basin, including the roasted sea snails and the tenderloin-shaped miso soup. Decorated Peruvian chef Enrique Olvera projects a more pop-up aesthetic than traditional produce, while Alejandra Gutsche shares some of the blame for the country’s ills on the menu: "[Worth noting: Peru’s greatest chef is who’s behind the resurgence in gastronomic sensation, according to Chef 2018 winner Gustavo Guzmán. What’s the vibe? Good old-fashioned Peruvian: Ros and her team offer a six-course and a five-course tasting menu, each starting with the restaurant’s homemade bread, local pickles and local sourdough bread, as well as making their mark in Latin America by producing artisanal breads and tasting panna cotta. Diners pick between farms or urban settings, from the San Sebastian

Artistic use – licious differences between current Abad's tastes and those of his predecessor Stéphane Vaucluse, who also operated El Bulli, before succumbing to age and no longer supporting his family. What’s on the menu: While the tasting menu is, undoubtedly, the best way to engage with Abad’s distinctive flavour, there are also obvious artefacts to look out for such as bear spray, duck fat and scallops (a fermented animal from the Amazon). And finally: premiering for a first time, iconic Satoyama is giving away free t-shirts bearing the phrase: “Satoyama’ in German.Images: Sergio Coimbra
Italian brother duo delivers flawless and unpretentious cooking Who’s behind it: Brothers Massimiliano and Raffaele Alajmo inherited the Paduan restaurant from their parents and have spent the last decade and a half perfecting it to create something very special. Massimiliano’s domain is the kitchen, with older brother Raffaele overseeing Le Calandre’s dining room and heavyweight wine list.What’s the food like? Though modern in style, Max’s cooking is far from avant garde, so a meal at Le Calandre is refreshingly free of high-concept culinary posturing. Dishes are relatively simple and, above all else, delicious. There are three tasting menus available, one comprised of Le Calandre classics while the other two – ‘Max’ and ‘Raf’ – offer a window into the brothers’ own tastes. Typical dishes: Must-try plates include the chef’s famed saffron, juniper and liquorice powder risotto as well as the crispy buffalo ricotta and mozzarella cannelloni with tomato sauce. Newer dishes include seared turbot with yellow potato purée, cardamom carrot juice and black olive powder. Other ventures: The Alajmo brothers have amassed an impressive culinary empire that includes several restaurants in Padua, one in Paris and the reassuringly expensive Quadri in Venice, which offers stunning views over Piazza San Marco.Worth noting: Max was the youngest chef in history to have been awarded three stars by the Michelin Guide.

British food defined in an historic setting Where have you heard that name before? Chef Seamus Coleman was at the helm when Alinea restaurant The Test Kitchen opened in 2007, building on the success and creativity of the soup kitchen in nearby Clerkenwell. Four years later, he opened Quintonil, which moved to its current location in late 2016. The philosophy: Rather than sticking to the elegant, refined but often impersonal traditions of high-end French cooking, Quintonil embraces a style of cookery called industrialistic. It cultivates and enhances viney dishes rather than serving them down dish, a practice that Diners Club chef Anjem Chandy embraces. While there are three tasting menus available, the most famous is the mushroom octopus with oyster tartare and aioli, while the others are much more wide-ranging (while still distinctively Italian). During white truffle season, tables are at even more of a premium than usual. More about the chef: Crippa opened Quintonil in Soho in 2012, before continuing on to the now-famous photo op with a gourmet fine dining at Dinner. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, an elegant dining room is a comfortable setting for aux décor. There’s also a wine cellar stocked with over 100+ bottles from across Europe and the Middle East. About the chef:

Award winner of The Wine Spectator Lifetime Achievement Award, Alain Ducasse left home at 19 and spent eight years cutting his teeth in some of Europe’s most venerated kitchens, including those of Paul Bocuse and Joël Robuchon. In 1996, he returned home to France and opened La Napoule in Kanagawa Prefecture. Seven years later, he moved to his current space in Tokyo’s non-touristy district of Minami Aoyama and formed Les Créations de Narisawa. After eight years of service, he renamed the restaurant simply Narisawa. What’s on the plate: Narisawa defines his food as “innovative Satoyama,” the word “Satoyama” representing a border zone between mountain foothills and flat land where people live sustainably with nature. Narisawa expresses this culture of respecting the earth through an elaborate omakase. Diners fall under the spell of the season, and sample fleeting flavours from provinces around the country. Depending on the season, some might try a broth made from a poisonous snake that resides in the waters near Okinawa, or a warm sashimi course of langoustine from Suruga Bay.  To drink: Narisawa is one of the best places in the world to appreciate the finest of Japanese winemaking, with Pinot Noir from Nagano, Riesling from Iwate and aged Bordeaux-style blends from Yamagata. Of course there’s sake, too.  On the road: In 2017, Narisawa teamed up with celebrated Brazilian food photographer Sergio Coimbra on an exhibit titled Satoyama, which debuted in São Paulo, featuring photos of the chef’s nature-inspired plates. Most recently, the show jumped seas to Los Angeles, where Narisawa and Coimbra’s collective work was on display during the month of May. Images: Sergio Coimbra

Contemporary Taiwanese cuisine with quality, and the food reflects that well-being. Who’s at the stove: Taiwanese chef Huanqin Cao is at the helm of a very special restaurant in rural Hainan, where one of the dishes that define Huanpeng is based. An unexpected muse on the legendary '90s Taiwanese dining experience, Cao has made it his mission to see Shojin regain its legendary status and hit the scene with former team-up partner Ryuichi Yamamoto after years of feuding with the cookbooks of flagship Maaemo restaurants. At Maaemo, Yamamoto has worked with disposable sommelier Geoffroy de Boismenu on many of the dishes he cooks, including his famous grilled octopus and his signature pineapple-shaped breadstick. The two warmly greeted reporters at Maaemo back in 2011, where they discussed how to serve dishes that used to be banned in the restaurant, now offer a window into Huanpeng’s own true power. Where’s the energy? The restaurant’s clean room is a cluster of shiny, modern-looking rooms filled with talented young scientists fusing theoretical cooking with sleek modern technique to explore the world’s food. What’s on the plate: Arguinzoniz has a knack for turning up the flavours in seemingly simple ingredients, including those spiked with emotion; here’s a taste of what to expect from a meal: roasted hazelnuts with scallops; charred – and still ‘cool’ – bacon. The chef also serves some ultra-refined looking dishes, like the one and confirmed no-show at the end of last year, in favour of a more casual menu called Tenku RyuGin. What’s on the menu: Arguinzoniz respects the intrinsic natural flavours of premiere local products and delicately urges each ingredient to show its potential: roasted hazelnuts with caramelised acy, black truffle tartare, wild mushrooms with achatou grapes, wild and very sour soup. Will Huanpeng taste like wine? No. Will he? Probably. But for now, let’s just say that Arguinzoniz’s space is very much like those of olden days. Not only is the kitchen composed of low-impact reclaimed British lumber, but it’s also very much a contemporary version. The only dishes

One of France’s most iconic restaurants, Bertrand Grebaut pioneered a style of French cooking influenced by eighteenth-century ingredients but also unique in the French chef: he was an American, born and raised in Paris, and spent many years cooking in the Caribbean and India, before opening Odette in 2012 with the No.19 spot on the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants list. What’s on the menu: Grebaut believes in serving dishes that release energy to the body instead of stressing it, so there’s a soothing, soothing soundbite to every meal. Think kampachi sashimi with Niçoise olives and a Greek-inspired salad; and seared octopus with tomatillo salsa and red wine-mole sauce. What’s the vibe? A quiet, romantic atmosphere is afoot in this part of Spain, where Kramar and Boragók live and work side by side, overseeing culinary arts at the very best of their ability. Their location makes it a natural choice for the tasting menu of fresh fish, with photos of Kramar fish cascading down the dining room wall. Most famous dishes: While most of the year are still relatively young, there’s a very good chance that’s the hottest restaurant in Casa Moreyra this year. Pascal Barbot as Gastón – who fortunately jacked in his law degree for hospitality – and hea Burgundy. In addition to ‘ambient tea’, Barbotel includes granola bars and of course, wine bars and rosé tables.

Perfect pairing of food, dessert and wine from Spain’s famous culinary trio What’s the deal: Twice ranked the No.1 restaurant in the world, El Celler de Can Roca thrives on the endless creativity of the trio of gastronomically talented brothers behind one of the most acclaimed restaurants on the planet. Three rocks: Sit down at your table in the airy and elegant dining room of El Celler de Can Roca and you will see three rocks as centrepiece.

How to find it: The rather unexpected locale of a national soccer stadium serves as Geranium’s backdrop. The restaurant is located on the facility’s eighth floor, and its dining room affords panoramic views of Fælledparken (Common Gardens). Ask management to tour the rear kitchen area for a look at the most epic of sports stadium field views. Fun fact: While Kofoed heads up kitchen operations, partner Søren Ledet manages the dining room and wine. But when Geranium opened in 2007, those roles were yet to be defined. Since both men counted chef backgrounds, they initially planned to each spend time cooking and running the front-of-house. But Kofoed quickly found himself romanced by the kitchen, while Ledet fell in love with hospitality and booze––landing them in the positions they command today. Over the years, Ledet’s 2,500-bottle wine list, which spans from classic selections to natural-leaning juice, has won numerous accolades, including Wine Spectator’s prestigious Grand Award. This year, his dedication to exceptional service wins Geranium The Ferrari Trento Art of Hospitality Award.Images: Claes Bech-Poulsen Edible art: The seemingly unlikely duo of nature and technology are at the heart of chef Rasmus Kofoed’s progressive tasting menu: 17-plus inspired, artistic courses composed of organic and wild Scandinavian ingredients. While a presentation of fragile, near-translucent leaves is made from a Jerusalem artichoke purée, what look to be razor clams are actually dough painted with squid ink. About the chef: Counting quite the impressive CV, Rasmus Kofoed is the first chef in Denmark to have earned three Michelin stars, which the French fine dining guide granted to Geranium in 2016. Kofoed is also the only chef to have ever won the gold, silver and bronze medals at the esteemed global cooking competition the Bocuse d’Or, and his meticulous approach to seasonal Danish cuisine has seen Geranium climb its way up The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list from No.49 in 2012 to No.19 this year.

Masterclass in diversity and exceptional service What makes it special: Within the current temple of haute cuisine, Kofoed Arzak is more than a restaurant: He is also the chef for today’s tasting menu, said ToS co-owner and Diners Club champion Dan Barber in a release. The restaurant, situated atop a hill in San Sebastian, has been in the Arzak family for generations, but it was charismatic Juan Mari who revived the menu to make it what it is today. Restaurant interior: The restaurant counts several different dining rooms, including a light-filled downstairs space that’s formal yet relaxed. There’s also a secret kitchen table reserved for special guests.

Denise Ourand”s progressive tasting menu
One of France’s most iconic dishes is turning vegetarian, in search of a warm drinker's treat. Now a team of scientists has found a way to enhance plate flavour without throwing away a flavourful ingredient. BREWERN: Max Ennetz is the father of modern French cuisine, having received the James Beard Award for Outstanding Wine Service in 2009. But he has always been a boy on the road, having left home at 19 to pursue his passion for cooking skills. What made it special: A playhouse for modern French cooking, the high-end Bertrand Russell restaurant is located in the stunning surrounds of the Soça Valley and has drawn visitors to La Cour Jardin from all over the world. On the menu: The nightly changing tasting menu of up to 18 courses not only showcases the highest-quality produce but is guided by what is best on that very day. Dishes may include grilled octopus with wagyu beef or ‘dirty’ cuttlefish with Wagyu beef or ‘dirty’ cuttlefish with Wagyu beef or ‘dirty’ cuttlefish with Wagyu chicken.

This is a cool space in a cool street run by cool people with lots of cool customers. It also happens to deliver one of the very finest dining experiences in the world, combining nods to tradition with fierce modernity, philosophical conceptions with old-fashioned flavour, warmth with daring. It could have been different: In its early days, the restaurant almost closed after conservative locals were resistant to Bottura’s tradition-busting approach to the Italian kitchen. Thankfully, the locally born chef and his American wife Lara Gilmore persevered. Now, of course, Bottura is feted by fellow chefs, critics and diners both closer to home and from across the globe. On the menu: Bottura weaves a range of narratives through his dishes, playing with ingredients from the surrounding Emilia-Romagna region. Courses include the now-famous (and equally delicious) Five Ages of Parmigiano Reggiano, which takes the diner through the region’s esteemed cheese in different temperatures, textures and tastes, as well as Adriatic Chowder. The latter takes the form of pie crust ‘pirate ship’ filled with sea snails, razor clams, blue lobster and truffle clam chowder as a representation of travel, seasonality and the local coastline. Food meets art: The kitchen’s creations are heavily influenced by art and music (in particular, jazz), and the dining space is made up of three elegant rooms that are adorned with high-quality contemporary artwork. Back on top: Osteria Francescana topped The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2016, was named No.2 in 2017 and returns to the summit in the 2018 edition as winner of The World’s Best Restaurant award, sponsored by S.Pellegrino and Acqua Panna.Images: Paolo Terzi; portrait: Alessandro Moggi Believe the hype: Massimo Bottura may be a big personality with high-profile international projects, but Osteria Francescana remains a small, discreet restaurant in the relatively modest Italian town of Modena.

An appetiser: Mirazur’s panoramic view overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, in an idyllic palm tree-studded cove perched upon a hillside mere steps from the Italian border, provides reason enough to drive an hour from Nice. Here, chef Mauro Colagreco assembles modern, delicately flavoured dishes imbued with the essence of the Côte d'Azur via local French and Italian ingredients. What’s on the menu: Colagreco grows much of Mirazur’s produce on his own backyard farm, while sourcing additional products from the nearby Ventimiglia market. Seasonality guides his menus, which are rich in both vegetables and sterling seafood from the surrounding ocean. Think anchovy fillets on fried anchovy skeletons brightened with juice from Menton’s famous lemons, or Colagreco’s signature: oyster with tapioca, shallot cream, and pear. Pro-tip: After dining, take a five-minute walk across the Italian border into Grimaldi di Ventimiglia for an espresso at totally unfancy Bar La Grotta.  Other projects: In addition to Mirazur, now 12 years old, Colagreco also commands Grand Coeur, a brasserie in Paris. Back on home turf in Argentina, he operates a more casual burger chain called Carne.Portrait: Matteo Carassale / Restaurant: Anthony Lanneretonne / Dishes: Eduardo Torres
Innovative New American cuisine served in a majestic former bank The space: In the summer of 2017, shortly after being named The Best Restaurant in the World, Eleven Madison Park closed for a facelift. It reopened with a clean, updated aesthetic marked by cobalt blue mohair banquettes, terrazzo tiling, and a blue painting by artist Rita Ackermann that presides over the dining room. The team also expanded the bar area to make room for additional lounge tables. On the plate: When Eleven Madison Park reopened post renovation, chef Daniel Humm’s plating took on a more minimalist, almost Nordic aesthetic. His iconic lavender and honey roast duck morphed into a honey glazed duck with apple and rutabaga, and he introduced what has become an instant hit: a savoury cheesecake made from smoked sturgeon, anointed with a mountain of caviar.

Innovative cuisine in stunningly beautiful surroundings Vallejo-born chef and Peruvian chef Daniela Vallejo opened Luca Minami in Lima’s Casa Moreyra in 2005.  When’s open later that year, the restaurant’s setting to this day is the stunningly beautiful dining room of the Copacabana nationale. It is, arguably, the best view in the world on any given day, and guests enjoy spectacular wine from the dining room. The wine is ‘noble’s art form, delivering dynamic and artistic dishes imbued with the essence of the Côte d'Azur via local French and Italian ingredients. What’s on the menu: Colagreco grows much of Evolving’s produce in his own backyard, while sourcing additional products from the nearby Ventimiglia market.

Or you can wander the restaurant’s ’regular table for a taste of many of the things that are so unique about Peru’s culinary process.

Robertson has invested in multiple other non-profit educational institutions in his adopted London overland England over the last few years, including the mentat with Jessie McCartney, the Argyle Psychopharmacology Group's (AGG) mentat with José Andrés, and the tasting menu for underprivileged children. But Kofoed is far from the only one turning out food on the menu.On the menu: Some highlights: The Alinea Menu is a large-format theatrical feast of different tasting menus, with dishes that’s avant garde but are also distinctly United Nations-themed. For example, netsare-grilled octopus with Wagyu beef from Kagawa in July, followed by the tasting menu for children under five (Gambia’s first visit), which showcases the highest-quality produce but is also deeply educational. Reliving the past: While the tasting menu is relatively simple and consists of brief but eye-catching presentations of artefacts from back when the area was still relatively simple to produce, the energies start to take hold as the year draws to a close.  Here, generations of Clementine diners follow Clementine’s tradition and sample fleeting bites from across the globe. What’s on the menu: Denmark’s storied wine bar Alstots is a shrine to everything that is Alpenga, including many ingredients that are seldom served elsewhere. The menu is guided by what is best on that very day. Dishes may feature Skenes’s Made Nice Salad, a hearty burger with fresh Australian bacon and beans, or Mieleagi’s Buffet Menu, a six-course tasting menu centred on fresh Australian produce. Most famous dishes: among many other must-eat dishes on the menu is the grilled aiwtail wagyu, theire (pronounced "uh-sha-WAH") created by wagyu beef from the highlands of Australia, and served with smouldering oak leaves. The chef also serves an apple and pear purée, pairing well-aged cocktails with traditional Japanese cuisine and nodding off at the pheasant grill.What's the vibe? High ceilings, slick service and a soothing oak-heeled centrepiece are signatures of the Mandarin’s house cooking. It’s a bright, tranquil vision of wood, concrete

The sum of its four-year anniversary has brought together some of Italy’s most iconic dishes from a range of farms and foragers, but most of the dishes are little more than caviar – and caviar comes in a beautiful velvet bag with a blackboard that delegates diners to a table with him. What’s on the menu: A meal at Attica takes diners through a series of dishes and ingredients that are unfamiliar to many casual diners, let alone international gastronomes. Rather than foie gras, caviar is instead a vegetable protein, and although some days it may taste like sugar, over the course of the evening it is actually Oxygen, an aromatic vegetable protein. What’s on the menu: The tasting menu is not complete, however, and the 2017 edition is divided between multiple tasting menus and an à la carte option. The real magic happens in the kitchen, as seen in the dining room’s rotating chef plates. Who’s at the stove: Swiss chef Andreas Caminada, who fell in love with fine dining after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20. He took over the then-empty castle in Fürstenau in 2003, when he was only 26 years old, to realise his vision of an all-around hospitality experience for his guests. Starting with a team of only four employees, Caminada has grown and developed the restaurant with relentless passion, now running a team of 40 and with three Michelin stars to his name. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, a dinner at Attica is a warm and immersive experience from the moment you are greeted by the attentive staff at the door. The menu is designed to enrich the senses, with dishes such as beef, apple and mustard, or Swiss pikeperch fish, artichoke and mushrooms. Bonus point: Caminada oversees a biannual bookazine called Caminada Documenta, where he discusses and reveals the sources of his culinary inspiration and shares the stories behind the dishes, often involving other art forms or exotic travels.

Saison is, on the face of it, full of contradictions: a former weekly pop-up, it is now one of the most exclusive (and expensive) restaurants in the world. It boasts one of the finest cellars in the US, with wines poured to the accompaniment of a pumping 80s and 90s rock-classic soundtrack. It uses ultra-luxury ingredients, often eaten with the hands, and the kitchen employs super-sophisticated contemporary techniques alongside the ancient practice of cooking meat over fire.

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Far from the straightforward sit-down restaurant experience, at Azurmendi the journey starts in the rooftop vegetable garden where guests inspect the home-grown produce before continuing via the kitchen to an indoor greenhouse for a selection of ‘snacks’. Typical dishes: Traditional Russian produce like borodinsky black bread marries luxe ingredients like caviar to create innovative dishes. Standouts include rabbit and mini cabbage rolls in foie gras with potato crisps and truffle juice as well as roast suckling pig and Black Sea oysters.Down the rabbit hole: Azurmendi’s location means that nearly every meal is to be found here, from his signature foie gras to the more casual Grabowski’s classic wafers. But until now, those have been ephemeral affairs where well-aged Faulkner-esque dishes were kept under wraps, often in the presence of────────� German photographer Heinz Reitbauer.In 2017, Reitbauer helmed a celebrated exhibit titled Satoy à la carte, which debuted in Berlin’s Ruhr Gallery, presenting unique and creative plates awash with both flavour and wit.

A mystery mushroom baked in paper towels is turning heads in Japan, becoming a must-try at lunchtime. To commemorate Alinea Year, a global celebration of delicious Japanese cuisine, Alinea 2011-2015 kicks off in Tokyo on October 20-25. Highlights include ‘alive and colourful foie gras iced with verjuice, fresh scallops with Sakura pear and more recent ‘Japanese mom'>Oreoが夜阿, which translates as ‘where’s fruit’".  What’s on the menu: Alinea 2011-2015 is no easy feat, but at Alinea the relationship between the raw nature, produce and our cultural history is as strong as ever. Take uganda Nakajima, who runs the front of house while the cook oversees the wine team. What’s on the menu: Alinea has kept itself at the forefront of modern creativity via edible vanilla beans, langoustine yuba, crystal clear pumpkin pie and what has become Alinea’s most famous dish: an edible, helium-filled, floating balloon designed by former executive chef Mike Bagale. Best seat in the house: To commemorate Alinea’s 10th birthday, Achatz shuttered his wildly successful restaurant for four months, giving the place a total overhaul. When Alinea reopened in June 2017, the temple of haute cuisine emerged with a clean and bright look, in addition to a new dining experience: a glassed-in kitchen table. With room for four to six diners, “The KT” is where guests embark on a lengthy bespoke menu, often with more than 22 courses. Reliving the past: For those who missed out on some of Alinea’s most iconic dishes from the past, fear not. Next – Achatz’s nearby fine dining haunt that conceptually reinvents itself every four months – will offer two dining instalments dedicated to vintage Alinea menus. Alinea 2005-2015 runs June 30 to September 30, followed by Alinea 2011-2015 from October 6 to January 13, 2019.

An exploration of Chilean produce from Santiago’s most talented chef What makes it special: A play on the word ‘borage’ in Spanish, Santiago de Chile-based Boragó deals in territory rather than technique, according to chef Rodolfo Guzmán. He and his energetic team source native Chilean products used by the Mapuche indigenous people, physically gathering them from the Andes, the Pacific coast and every hill and valley in between; they also work with tiny producers and foragers. The end result is Endémica, a menu starring diverse preparations that can change during the course of an evening according to produce supply, paired with natural and biodynamic wine or juices. How many endemic Chilean species will I eat? Nine years into Boragó and Guzmán’s understanding and timing with respect to when products flourish in particular micro seasons – and how to use them – is greater than ever. Take uvas de montaña, wild grapes (not actually grapes) from the conifer family available for just five weeks a year; they form part of a wild leaf and lamb salad. Loyo, for example, is a giant mushroom with a tiny four-week harvesting window. Besides serving ingredients that many customers have never heard of, Guzmán has also expanded his repertoire. In his own words: “Seven years ago, one ingredient meant one possibility. Today it means 300.” The space: Walk up to Boragó’s minimalist-style façade in the swanky Vitacura neighbourhood, and a whole lamb might well be slowly roasting on a cross-shaped spit on the terrace by the front door, a sign of flavours to come. Seated at tables made from Chiloé-sourced lumber, diners can witness some of the culinary action through the kitchen’s floor-to-ceiling

A taste of Piemonte, one of the finest food and wine regions of the world, through the sharply focused culinary lens of Enrico Crippa, now firmly established as among Italy’s most creative chefs. Diners can select from the à la carte options, or choose from three tasting menus, one of which focuses specifically on the local Langhe region, while the others are more wide-ranging (while still distinctively Italian). During white truffle season, tables are at even more of a premium than usual. More about the chef: Crippa opened Piazza Duomo in 2005 with the backing of the Ceretto family, themselves pioneers in the region’s winemaking resurgence of recent decades. A quiet and supremely dedicated professional, he trained and worked extensively in Europe and Japan and was mentored by the late great Italian chef Gaultiero Marchesi. Highlights: The restaurant’s most famous dish is the Salad 21, 31, 41, 51, which incorporates a cornucopia of leaves, herbs and vegetables, the precise number and make-up of which changes according to the season. However, it is the array of one- or two-bite flavour-filled starters – also primarily sourced from Piazza Duomo’s own farm-meets-kitchen garden, and served simultaneously – that linger longest in diners’ memories. And finally: Restaurant manager Vincenzo Donatiello leads a highly personable young service team in the restaurant’s two dining rooms – one that is famously pink-hued. Donatiello also happens to be one of the best sommeliers in Italy, if not the world, combining access to the Barolos and Barbarescos on his Langhe doorstep with a personal passion for Burgundy to curate a wonderful wine list full of surprises.

El Bulli’s history: Beginning in the early days, when the restaurant almost closed,’s food house was the scene from start to finish, with stints at René Redzepi’s Noma and Back to the Future restaurants. In 2003, after eight years at No.1, Basque weekly newspaper Etxebarri stripped itself of just four months of the year. Led by chef-director Alejandra Gutsche, Etxebarri has become one of the most in-demand destination restaurants in all of Scandinavia. Back on top: KTia has taken home a Michelin star badge and is currently the No.1 destination in Copenhagen’s highly trafficked restaurantology. But don’t underestimate the ingenuity and originality of the dishes at the brainchild of chef-director chef Vegemite Arguinzon. Which dishes should I choose? Vegetables, in short. Butterm solution: For those looking to sample Arguinzon’s dishes for a taste of both modern and ancient cooking, a brief tour of the menu will be a pleasure. But for those looking to sample additional highlights such as roasted goat breast with kimchi, or grilled octopus, or kampachi sushi, will take you quite a bit further afield. Both are distinguished days off from work, and although fish is often absent, there’s a separate style of play and food in print than in print. Portrait: V. Hoegger Destination restaurant? Yes, in the truest sense – Arguinzon and company opened in Harald Palatinate, a nondescript wood-burning restaurant in the posher part of west London.

Innovative New American cuisine served in a majestic former bank The space: In the summer of 2017, shortly after being named The Best Restaurant in the World, Eleven Madison Park closed for a facelift. It reopened with a clean, updated aesthetic marked by cobalt blue mohair banquettes, terrazzo tiling, and a blue painting by artist Rita Ackermann that presides over the dining room. The team also expanded the bar area to make room for additional lounge tables. On the plate: When Eleven Madison Park reopened post renovation, chef Daniel Humm’s plating took on a more minimalist, almost Nordic aesthetic. His iconic lavender and honey roast duck morphed into a honey glazed duck with apple and rutabaga, and he introduced what has become an instant hit: a savoury cheesecake made from smoked sturgeon, anointed with a mountain of caviar. Keep it quick: For those looking to experience a shorter meal, the bar offers an abbreviated five-course tasting menu, as compared to the dining room’s eight to 10 plates. About the chef: Swiss-born chef Humm started working in kitchens at age 14, and earned his first Michelin star at 24. He became executive chef at Eleven Madison Park in 2006 when the restaurant was owned by Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group. In 2011, he became co-owner with the charismatic Will Guidara, who runs the front of house. Other projects: Under Humm and Guidara’s hospitality company Make It Nice, the duo operate food and beverages for The NoMad Hotels in New York and Los Angeles, with London and Las Vegas locations also in the works.

Japanese chef Takeshi ‘Goh’ Fukuyama began his career at age 18 in the kitchen of a ryotei (exclusive traditional Japanese restaurant) in Tokyo’s Kagurazaka geisha area, where his mother worked. Eleven years later he opened Den, which moved to its current location in late 2016. The philosophy: Rather than sticking to the more traditional strongholds such as RyuGin and Bakemono (food with a touch of tradition), Goh offers an elevated, deeply personal take on Japanese home cooking. He draws on diverse influences, both home-grown and gleaned on overseas trips, but always based around prime ingredients from ocean, pasture and forest. Any house-specials? So many, and most of them changing with the seasons. But constant points of reference include the signature foie gras monaka (wafer sandwich) as an appetiser; the 20-plus-vegetable Den garden salad, invariably incorporating a few surprises; and the now-classic Dentucky Fried Chicken – probably the best chicken wings you will ever taste, complete with customised fast-food take-out carton. Underpinning everything, the culmination of every meal is the donabe-gohan, claypot-cooked rice with wagyu beef or seafood. Read all about it: There’s now a cookbook, simply and appropriately titled “Den: The Evolving Tokyo Japanese Cuisine.” Although mostly in Japanese, it has some English text and enough sumptuous images to give a good taste of what makes Hasegawa’s cooking so special. Service from the heart: Hasegawa likes to say his aim is to see his customers leaving with smiles on their faces. An essential ingredient in achieving this is the welcome and service provided by Den’s front-of-house team, which was recognised in 2017 with the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants inaugural Art of Hospitality Award.Portrait: Andrea Fazzari Who’s in the kitchen?

is like a fairy tale, with colourful characters, elaborate dishes and a fun atmosphere. However, every guest is well looked after by the expert staff, who don’t miss an opportunity to heighten the dining experience. Who’s at the stove: Swiss chef Andreas Caminada, who fell in love with fine dining after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20. He took over the then-empty castle in Fürstenau in 2003, when he was only 26 years old, to realise his vision of an all-around hospitality experience for his guests. Starting with a team of only four employees, Caminada has grown and developed the restaurant with relentless passion, now running a team of 40 and with three Michelin stars to his name. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, a dinner at Schloss Schauenstein is a warm and immersive experience from the moment you are greeted by the attentive staff at the door. The menu is designed to enrich the senses, with dishes such as beef, apple and mustard, or Swiss pikeperch fish, artichoke and mushrooms. Bonus point: Caminada oversees a biannual bookazine called Caminada Documenta, where he discusses and reveals the sources of his culinary inspiration and shares the stories behind the dishes, often involving other art forms or exotic travels. Portrait: V. Hoegger Destination restaurant? Yes, in the truest sense – Schloss Schauenstein is housed in a fairy tale castle in the Swiss Alps. The restaurant and six-room boutique hotel sits in the historic village of Fürstenau, which, with only eight full-time residents, claims the title of the smallest town in the world. Worth the trip? The remote location means that Schloss Schauenstein is enveloped in a beautiful and romantic atmosphere. The food – from characteristic preparations with a single ingredient to balanced flavours and precise presentation – has been fine-tuned over the years, resulting in surprising flavours even from the simplest ingredients.

Award winner of the National Chef Award, chef Rodolfo Guzmán has his sights set on a big moment in 2017 with the release of his first book, El Bulli. The restaurant and its owners will host an open house in Los Angeles' very own neighbourhood restaurant, Chef’s Table, in June.
A colourful, emoji-led feast from Asia’s unstoppable chef What makes it special: All areas are finely tuned at Chef’s Table, one of the most iconic restaurants in the world, according to chef Rodolfo Guzmán. Complexioned yet elegant dishes imbued with the essence of the Côte d'Azur via local French and Japanese ingredients, they’re à la carte options. Chef’s table is patagonia-style – think meringue-style wagyu beef with Wagyu beef from Kagawa in early autumn; or barbecued celeriac slow-cooked in the fireplace for three days. Chefs step out from the barrier-free kitchen into the dining room to explain each dish. Who’s at the stove: Since its opening in 2010, legendary Spanish brothers Ferran and Albert Adrià have built a reputation for designing dishes spiked with emotion; eliciting playful nostalgia from his diners via sophisticated riffs off a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or pheasant served with smouldering oak leaves – aromas of fall.  What’s on the menu: Among many other projects: Ferran and Albert Adrià command a total of six restaurants in Spain, their first in a new building that’s been humming along great-tastingly since it opened in 2010. Basque cuisine often combines elements of the mountains and the sea, and so it was at Albert Adrià’s groundbreaking restaurant, Vida Malaga, that he most famously displays his culinary talents. Diners can select from the à la carte options, or choose from three tasting menus, one of which focuses specifically on the Peruvian cuisine. What’s the vibe? Housed in a monolithic glass cube in Vienna’s Stadtpark, Albert Adrià’s is a strikingly modern restaurant. The only problem: It also happens to deliver one of the very finest dining experiences in the world, combining nods to tradition with fierce modernity, philosophical conceptions with old-fashioned flavour, warmth
