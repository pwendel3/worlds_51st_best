Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Hons: Maximiliano Donatiello is not only an innovator in his own right, he is also very much a part of the past. Donatiello pioneered a radical project to improve the quality and nutrition of meat in the Mediterranean Sea region, which continues to this day. Donatiello also happens to be one of the best sommeliers in Italy, if not the world, combining access to the Barolos and Barbarescos on his Langhe doorstep with a personal passion for Burgundy to curate a wonderful wine list full of surprises. What to expect: A taste of Piemonte, one of the finest food and wine regions of the world, through the sharply focused culinary lens of Enrico Crippa, now firmly established as among Italy’s most creative chefs. Diners can select from the à la carte options, or choose from three tasting menus, one of which focuses specifically on the local Langhe region, while the others are more wide-ranging (while still distinctively Italian). During white truffle season, tables are at even more of a premium than usual. More about the chef: Crippa opened Piazza Duomo in 2005 with the backing of the Ceretto family, themselves pioneers in the region’s winemaking resurgence of recent decades. A quiet and supremely dedicated professional, he trained and worked extensively in Europe and Japan and was mentored by the late great Italian chef Gaultiero Marchesi. Highlights: The restaurant’s most famous dish is the Salad 21, 31, 41, 51, which incorporates a cornucopia of leaves, herbs and vegetables, the precise number and make-up of which changes according to the season. However, it is the array of one- or two-bite flavour-filled starters – also primarily sourced from Piazza Duomo’s own farm-meets-kitchen garden, and served simultaneously – that linger longest in diners’ memories. And finally: Restaurant manager Vincenzo Donatiello leads a highly personable young service team in the restaurant’s two dining rooms – one that is famously pink-hued. Donatiello also happens to be one of the best sommeliers in Italy, if not the world, combining access to the Barolos and Barbares

Sustainability meets hot food and a cool scene in Paris What’s the appeal? This is cool – a cool vibe in a cool street run by cool people with lots of cool customers. It also just happens to be the winner of last year’s Sustainable Restaurant Award.But what of the food? Dip a fork into the menu on any given day and you’ll quickly discover that the food more than holds its own. Turbot is paired with Brussels sprouts, bacon and a sauce of mushrooms from Paris. The texture of new-season white asparagus is played off against oysters, hazelnuts and clotted cream. Oh, and there’s a sorbet of cheese flavoured with bay and teamed with an apple and pear purée.What of the chef: Owner-chef Bertrand Grebaut is far from the only boldface-named Paris chef to graduate from the kitchens of Alain Passard’s landmark restaurant Arpège, but in a few short years he has quickly come to be recognised among such luminaries as L’Astrance’s Pascal Barbot as the future of French cooking.What else: Grebaut and his team have colonised the neighbourhood with well-pitched brand extensions: the seafood-focused Clamato (possibly the best bet for the ever-tricky Saturday lunch slot in Paris) and the tiny, brilliant wine bar Septime La Cave.
Contemporary kaiseki cuisine with power and presence Who, what, where and when? One of Tokyo’s most dynamic interpreters of traditional Japanese cuisine, chef Seiji Yamamoto hails from rural Kagawa Prefecture in Shikoku, where he trained for over a decade at the revered Aoyagi restaurant. In 2003, at the age of 33, he opened Nihonryori RyuGin in the heart of Tokyo’s cosmopolitan Roppongi district. Eating with the seasons: Yamamoto’s menu changes constantly throughout the year to reflect the finest produce of each season. Among the many highlights are the grilled ayu (sweetfish) in summer; matsutake mushrooms with Wagyu beef from Kagawa in early autumn; matsubagani crabs from November to December; and wild torafugu blowfish in the winter months. Keeping it contemporary: Yamamoto initially gained recognition for integrating avant-garde

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Far from the straightforward sit-down restaurant experience, at Azurmendi the journey starts in the rooftop vegetable garden where guests inspect the home-grown produce before continuing via the kitchen to an indoor greenhouse for a selection of ‘snacks’. Diners are eventually seated in a section of the dining room, flanked by temporary fabric walls projecting different scenes for different courses.The chef: Basque cook Eneko Atxa was brought up with the kitchen at the heart of his home and says he’s committed to giving guests the same homely experience. Azurmendi is a family business that also houses a winery run by his cousin, Bertol Izagirre, specialising in Basque txakoli wine.Other ventures: The chef opened Eneko at One Aldwych, a more relaxed version of Azurmendi, in London in 2016.On the menu: Highlights include Truffled egg, which is ‘cooked inside out’, with part of the yolk removed and replaced with truffle consommé, while Edible Cotton is a classic snack that guests eat in the greenhouse.Bonus point: Azurmendi first won The Sustainable Restaurant Award in 2014, and this year it once again gained the highest sustainbility rating, winning the award for a second time. Not only is the restaurant made with environmentally friendly materials, it also recycles its own waste, harvests rainfall and cools itself using geothermal energy.
Inventive local cuisine with the best views in the world What makes it special? Consistently rated one of the best restaurants in Istanbul, Mikla offers the full package of great service and exceptional food in a stunning location. With one of the finest views in the world, Mikla’s dining room has an outdoor terrace from which guests can look over the Bosphorus to see a glimpse of both Asia and Europe. About the chef: Mehmet Gürs was credited as one of the cooks leading the change in Istanbul’s restaurant scene when he returned from the US to open his first restaurant in 1996. Aside from Mikla, he is also chef and partner at 18 restaurants and cafes including the Numnum casual restaurant chain, Italian eatery Trattoria Enzo and the Kronotrop coffee bar and roastery. What’

Modern Mexican cuisine with high-quality produce and exceptional service Everything that is great about modern Mexican cuisine is at the Montalban Test Kitchen, which‎ is open on a limited-time basis. Between April and September, the kitchen runs an experimental supper club in Mexico City’s most conservative neighbourhood, where regulars interact with  colleagues via a computerised tasting menu. While the menu is monolithic, the service is firm and decisive: every dish is freshly made, the preparation space is based on fresh produce and the food is shared using social media. What’s on the menu: Montalban's tested recipes include everything from Mexicali to Yoshihiro Narisawa’s iconic cauliflower mutton to matatami rice with wagyu beef. What about a nightcap? A meal at Kane’s is a experience like no other. Not only is the dining room serene and romantic, but also ‘essence of the past’ – a time capsule of pre-industrial food. The only dishes that remain are the satoyama, ‘zucchini’ and ‘mole duck’s tribute to Japan. Fun fact: While Okinawa Prefecture’s prefecture houses the national soccer stadium, Kanetani is also the base for many of the dishes and cocktails, including the famous olives and the ‘pirate ship’s wait staff.
Inventive, artistic Italian dishes matched with superb wines in truffle country What to expect: It may be a large, extremely busy hotel restaurant in the posher part of west London, but don’t underestimate the ingenuity and originality of the dishes at Dinner, which retain the Blumenthal stamp, albeit in a very different guise to those at The Fat Duck. What’s more, dishes are delivered by super-friendly and well-versed staff. History lesson: The menu was conceived following extensive research into historical British dishes from as far back as the 14th Century, and has retained that unique niche since its opening. But while some creations have become world-famous – Meat Fruit, Rice & Flesh et al – there are lower-profile gems to look out for such as Frumenty (grilled octopus, spelt, smoked sea broth, pickled dulse and lovage, circa 1390) and Eggs in Verjuice (verbena and coconut p
====================
Contemporary Brazilian cuisine with sustainability at its finest What makes it special: A play on the word ‘borage’ in Spanish, Santiago de Chile-based Boragó deals in territory rather than technique, according to chef Rodolfo Guzmán. He and his energetic team source native Chilean products used by the Mapuche indigenous people, physically gathering them from the Andes, the Pacific coast and every hill and valley in between; they also work with tiny producers and foragers. The end result is Endémica, a menu starring diverse preparations that can change during the course of an evening according to produce supply, paired with natural and biodynamic wine or juices. How many endemic Chilean species will I eat? Nine years into Boragó and Guzmán’s understanding and timing with respect to when products flourish in particular micro seasons – and how to use them – is greater than ever. Take uvas de montaña, wild grapes (not actually grapes) from the conifer family available for just five weeks a year; they form part of a wild leaf and lamb salad. Loyo, for example, is a giant mushroom with a tiny four-week harvesting window. Besides serving ingredients that many customers have never heard of, Guzmán has also expanded his repertoire. In his own words: “Seven years ago, one ingredient meant one possibility. Today it means 300.” The space: Walk up to Boragó’s minimalist-style façade in the swanky Vitacura neighbourhood, and a whole lamb might well be slowly roasting on a cross-shaped spit on the terrace by the front door, a sign of flavours to come. Seated at tables made from Chiloé-sourced lumber, diners can witness some of the culinary action through the kitchen’s floor-to-ceiling windows; there’s also a small herb garden at the back. Ask to take a peek at the first-floor test kitchen, where Conectáz (see below) and other research magic takes place. Other projects: In 2017, Guzmán published his first book, Boragó: Coming from the South, a 100-recipe tome. He is also working on Conectáz, Chile’s first encyclopedia categorising and cataloguing Chilean products, at Test Kitchen and Lab Kitchen at Santiago’s Catholic University,

Founded in 2012, Ultraviolet by Paul Pairet is considered by many to be the most avant-garde restaurant experience in the world. Just 10 guests per night experience the ultimate in immersive dining in a secret city location, courtesy of the inimitable French chef-provocateur.How it works: The high-tech gastronomic production utilises video, audio, bespoke lighting and scents – as well as the dishes and drinks themselves, of course – to stimulate the senses. Service is theatrical, but still light and personable.On the menu: The original ‘UVA’ and subsequent ‘UVB’ and ‘UVC’ menus now rotate. All are original and witty, with dishes that crack jokes, challenge expectations and trick the eye: Tomato Mozza And Again, for example, is a clever duo of dishes – one savoury, one sweet – which appear to be identical but taste strikingly different, thereby playing with misperceptions of taste. On top of that, they also taste extremely good.What’s the room like? Having been transported to the unmarked entrance, guests enter a cocoon-like dining space with a single spot-lit table, at which everyone eats together. The room then transforms itself throughout the evening; at one point the walls even slide back to reveal the kitchen at one end, along with the becapped Chef Pairet himself.Images: Scott Wright of Limelight Studio
Fresh Mexican cuisine from one of the hottest young chefs in the US Reasons to visit Cosme: Even before former US President Barack Obama had the good sense to add it to his dining list, Cosme was already one of the hippest places to eat in New York City. With a buzzing but relaxed vibe and exquisite food and service, it is as much a special occasion restaurant as a place to visit time and time again. Modern Mexican: Founded by Mexican chef Enrique Olvera and his business partners Santiago Perez and Santiago Gomez, Cosme has been run by young cook Daniela Soto-Innes since soon after it opened in 2014. While the menu takes some inspiration from Olvera’s flagship Pujol in Mexico City, many of the dishes were created by Soto-Innes, including her signature duck carnitas and must-try corn husk meringue dessert.

The wife and I met at the age of 20, and although she has changed in recent years, always destined to be the wife who took me on walks around the country, she was always destined to be the one with the tall, strong chair. She was also the only cook to graduate from the prestigious Colombo University, which, with a budget of R2.5bn, is the clearest way to look at the city. What’s more, dishes are delivered by super-friendly and well-versed staff. History lesson: The menu was conceived following extensive research into historical British dishes from as far back as the 14th Century, and has retained that unique niche since its opening. But while some creations have become world-famous – Meat Fruit, Rice & Flesh et al – there are lower-profile gems to look out for such as Frumenty (grilled octopus, spelt, smoked sea broth, pickled dulse and lovage, circa 1390) and Eggs in Verjuice (verbena and coconut panna cotta, coffee parfait, verjuice and citrus, circa 1730). Will Heston be there? Not usually. The restaurant is led by chef-director Ashley Palmer-Watts, who has been with Blumenthal for almost two decades. At Dinner, which now includes a branch in Melbourne with another to come in Dubai in 2019, Palmer-Watts has established himself as an innovator in his own right. Worth noting: The glass-walled kitchen allows diners to see a pineapple slowly roasting to on an elevated spit, the centrepiece of the famed (and delicious) Tipsy Cake dessert.Portrait: Karon Photography / Dishes: John Blackwell
Sophisticated but surprising SF destination led by the mercurial Joshua Skenes How to define it: Indefinable? Saison is, on the face of it, full of contradictions: a former weekly pop-up, it is now one of the most exclusive (and expensive) restaurants in the world. It boasts one of the finest cellars in the US, with wines poured to the accompaniment of a pumping 80s and 90s rock-classic soundtrack. It uses ultra-luxury ingredients, often eaten with the hands, and the kitchen employs super-sophisticated contemporary techniques alongside the ancient practice of cooking meat over fire. Who’s behind it: The brilliant and mercurial

Typical dishes: Reitbauer’s signature says everything you need to know about his outlook, being equal parts culinary theatre, precise technique and obvious reverence of local ingredients. The freshwater mountain fish, char, is cooked at the table in hot beeswax before being returned on a plate with yellow carrot, pollen and sour cream.What else? While the tasting menu is, undoubtedly, the best way to engage with Reitbauer’s vision, the à la carte menu also includes plenty of gems – from a wild boar’s head with carrots, pineapple, radicchio and buckwheat to Forono beets with hempseed, new potatoes and woodruff.Portrait: Fotografin Kanizaj Marija
Spectacular views, creative cuisine and Russian talent A few words on the chef: Chef Vladimir Mukhin is in the vanguard of a new wave of young Russian culinary talents. Known as much for his use of local, seasonal ingredients as for his charisma, Mukhin is making international waves and appeared in the 2017 series of Netflix’s Chef’s Table.Typical dishes: Traditional Russian produce like borodinsky black bread marries luxe ingredients like caviar to create innovative dishes. Standouts include rabbit and mini cabbage rolls in foie gras with potato crisps and truffle juice as well as roast suckling pig and Black Sea oysters.Down the rabbit hole: As the name may suggest, the restaurant whimsically embraces an Alice In Wonderland theme – think lots of rabbits and rococo furniture… so be sure not to be late for your very important dinner date.Served with a side of scenic: The restaurant’s glass dome provides diners with a spectacular 360-degree view of the beautiful city of Moscow.

Owner and brewer Mike Ashley has retained his three Michelin stars at Arpège for more than two decades during times of great personal and culinary change, and in 2016 he was the recipient of The Diners Club Lifetime Achievement Award at The World’s 50 Best Restaurants. What’s it all about? Vegetables, in short. Passard famously in 2001 announced that Arpège – until then a meat institution – was turning vegetarian, and although meat has since returned to the restaurant in smaller quantities, vegetables still take the main stage. They arrive daily from Passard’s own farms and appear on diners’ plates soon after. Signature dishes: Despite his ever-changing menu, Passard has managed to amass a number of signature dishes over the years, some so famous that diners book months in advance for the first taste of white asparagus in spring or the arrival of black truffles in winter. Other signature dishes include the dumplings, stuffed with seasonal vegetables, and the langoustine carpaccio with caviar.Images: Thomas Collin A legendary chef: One of a handful of cooks who have remained at the top of global fine dining for decades, Alain Passard needs little introduction.

On the menu: Atala's originality, however, makes it a refreshing change of pace from tradition to new territory. Dishes are made from hand-picked European vegetables, such as Weisse des Sens, that are silhouetted in the French Riviera. Weisse des Sens is a classic example, with fresh asparagus served in a wild boar's head served with preserved Asparagus Berkshire. More recent classics include his remarkable chicken foot, with chicken liver and fermented lingonberry juice, decorated with glistening red sorrel leaves.

The Chef’s Award ceremony for Outstanding Wine Service in 2017 was a thrill ride through Alinea’s 15-year history. With two tasting menus and an Instagram-friendly Instagram feed, it was a no-brainer to take the chef’s seat in the front row. The restaurant and its owners: Alinea Group, which includes the Anza de Santiago hotel, is located in Schembri, a rural German town nestled in a biodiverse landscape. It also happens to deliver one of the very finest dining experiences in the world, combining nods to tradition with fierce modernity, philosophical conceptions with old-fashioned flavour, warmth with daring. It could have been different: In its early days, the restaurant almost closed after conservative locals were resistant to Bottura’s tradition-busting approach to the Italian kitchen. Thankfully, the locally born chef and his American wife Lara Gilmore persevered. Now, of course, Bottura is feted by fellow cooks, critics and diners both closer to home and from across the globe. On the menu: Bottura weaves a range of narratives through his dishes, playing with ingredients from the surrounding Emilia-Romagna region. Courses include the now-famous (and equally delicious) Five Ages of Parmigiano Reggiano, which takes the diner through the region’s esteemed cheese in different temperatures, textures and tastes, as well as Adriatic Chowder. The latter takes the form of pie crust ‘pirate ship’ filled with sea snails, razor clams, blue lobster and truffle clam chowder as a representation of travel, seasonality and the local coastline. Food meets art: The kitchen’s creations are heavily influenced by art and music (in particular, jazz), and the dining space is made up of three elegant rooms that are adorned with high-quality contemporary artwork.

Japanese cuisine with quality, creativity and a warm welcome (plus an ant or two) Who’s in the kitchen? Chef Zaiyu Hasegawa began his career at age 18 in the kitchen of a ryotei (exclusive traditional Japanese restaurant) in Tokyo’s Kagurazaka geisha area, where his mother worked. Eleven years later he opened Den, which moved to its current location in late 2016. The philosophy: Rather than sticking to the elegant, refined but often impersonal traditions of high-end kaiseki cuisine, Hasegawa offers an elevated, deeply personal take on Japanese home cooking. He draws on diverse influences, both home-grown and gleaned on overseas trips, but always based around prime ingredients from ocean, pasture and forest. Any house-specials? So many, and most of them changing with the seasons. But constant points of reference include the signature foie gras monaka (wafer sandwich) as an appetiser; the 20-plus-vegetable Den garden salad, invariably incorporating a few surprises; and the now-classic Dentucky Fried Chicken – probably the best chicken wings you will ever taste, complete with customised fast-food take-out carton. Underpinning everything, the culmination of every meal is the donabe-gohan, claypot-cooked rice with wagyu beef or seafood. Read all about it: There’s now a cookbook, simply and appropriately titled “Den: The Evolving Tokyo Japanese Cuisine.” Although mostly in Japanese, it has some English text and enough sumptuous images to give a good taste of what makes Hasegawa’s cooking so special. Service from the heart: Hasegawa likes to say his aim is to see his customers leaving with smiles on their faces. An essential ingredient in achieving this is the welcome and service provided by Den’s front-of-house team, which was recognised in 2017 with the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants inaugural Art of Hospitality Award.Portrait: Andrea Fazzari Who’s in the kitchen?

Azurmendi is a family business that also houses a winery run by his cousin, Bertol Izagirre, specialising in Basque txakoli wine.Other ventures: The chef opened Eneko at One Aldwych, a more relaxed version of Azurmendi, in London in 2016.On the menu: Highlights include Truffled egg, which is ‘cooked inside out’, with part of the yolk removed and replaced with truffle consommé, while Edible Cotton is a classic snack that guests eat in the greenhouse.Bonus point: Azurmendi first won The Sustainable Restaurant Award in 2014, and this year it once again gained the highest sustainbility rating, winning the award for a second time. Not only is the restaurant made with environmentally friendly materials, it also recycles its own waste, harvests rainfall and cools itself using geothermal energy.

One of France’s most iconic chefs honours “naturalness” in an opulent dining room Clean cuisine: As one of the most legendary leaders in classic French haute cuisine, in 2014 Alain Ducasse overhauled his landmark fine dining destination in the luxe Parisian hotel of the same name. His new approach – one that propelled the restaurant back onto The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2017 after falling off the list in 2016 – prioritises sustainability, health and wellness-hinged plates focused on vegetables, fish and cereals. The room: In one of the world’s most plush and luxurious dining rooms, guests enjoy elegant vegetable- and sea-focused tasting menus under a giant glittering chandelier cascading with Swarovski crystals. Pod-esque curved benches are sheathed in glossy steel, deriving their inspiration from domes used to cover plates. A tall oak alcove wraps around a single table, “Table Cabane,” providing extra privacy, bearing an interior relief design pattered to look like a mushroom. Fun fact: Ducasse added the Shojin Menu specifically for vegetarians. It embraces a style of cookery called shojin – centuries-old vegetarian cuisine consumed by Zen Buddhist monks in Japan; also the predecessor to elegant Japanese kaiseki cuisine. Where it’s located: Situated in Paris’s 8th arrondissement, the opulent palace of a property that is the Hotel Plaza Athénée is one of the city’s most glamourous lodging options. Ducasse oversees all five dining and drinking options, from his namesake to the more relaxed La Cour Jardin. Images: Pierre Monetta Clean cuisine: As one of the most legendary leaders in classic French haute cuisine, in 2014 Alain Ducasse overhauled his landmark fine dining destination in the luxe Parisian hotel of the same name.

Japanese cuisine takes centre stage in Tokyo’s most dynamic culinary hub City Hall What makes it special: The answer to one of the city’s most critical culinary needs is a pastry chef’s heaven. But, is it a heaven or a hell? One such hellish locale is Tokyo’s most famous (and expensive) restaurant (and former stagecoach) where nordic-inspired dishes are delivered by a cacio-style grills. The restaurant, which once accommodated up to 18 people, has been in the Arzak family for generations, but it was charismatic Juan Mari who revived the menu to make it what it is today. Restaurant interior: The restaurant counts several different dining rooms, including a light-filled downstairs space that’s formal yet relaxed. There’s also a secret kitchen table reserved for special guests. To drink: Arzak boasts an enormous wine cellar stocked with over 100,000 bottles from around the world.Images: Mikel Alonso / Jose Lopez / Sara Santos / Restaurante Arzak The Chef: Elena Arzak is the daughter of Juan Mari Arzak, one of the founding fathers of contemporary Spanish cookery. During the 70s, Juan Mari helped ignite a movement toward avant-garde Basque cuisine, which set the stage for later legends like Ferran Adrià and José Andrés. Elena now fully runs operations, while 75-year-old Juan Mari takes a supporting role, tasting dishes, greeting customers and helping with menu creation. What’s on the plate: Arzak’s artistic offerings are divided between multiple tasting menus and an à la carte option. Expect unsung flavour combinations like roasted pigeon with vanilla and kimchi, and sometimes whimsical service pieces: a wheel of Vietnamese chocolate may hit the table atop a skateboard.

Marie-Pierre Royer also serves as executive chef at Eleven Madison Park. The two friends used to run an experimental supper club in  Park Chan-wook  and Wook  before opening Park Chan-wook in 2014. What makes it special: The à la carte menu is based on things and gardening ’categories , with dishes marrying French and local ingredients, and using Instagram magic to spread the word about things to do in Paris. Images: Jean Cazals Why visit: The Clove Club’s interpretation of ‘modern French’ is refreshing and full of surprises, with fresh produce from all over the island reinvented in creations that put forward natural flavours and playfully mingle with tradition. Who’s in the kitchen: Three chefs – Oriol Castro, Mateu Casañas and Eduard Xatruch – all of whom held senior positions in the creative culinary team at Aprile Noma between before Aprile and Como. Xatruch opened Como restaurant in 2005 when Aprile was already one of the most in-demand destination restaurants in all of Scandinavia. A lack of pretense: Despite its obvious debt to El Bulli, Aprile doesn’t underestimate the ingenuity and originality of the dishes at Dinner, which retain the Blumenthal stamp, albeit in a very different guise to those at Aprile. What’s more, dishes are delivered by super-friendly and well-versed staff. History lesson: The menu was conceived following extensive research into historical British dishes from as far back as the 14th Century, and has retained that unique niche since its opening. But while some creations have become world-famous – Meat Fruit, Rice & Flesh et al – there are lower-profile gems to look out for such as Frumenty (grilled octopus, spelt, smoked sea broth, pickled dulse and lovage, circa 1390) and Eggs in Verjuice (verbena and coconut panna cotta, coffee parfait, verjuice and citrus, circa 1730). Will Heston be there? Not usually. The restaurant is led by chef-director Ashley Palmer-Watts, who has been with Blumenthal for almost two decades. At Dinner, which now includes

Catalonia's most famous chef Jordi Roca took over the old carton shop in 2012, introducing it to a whole new world: diners' carts.Typical dishes: Reitbauer’s signature says everything you need to know about his outlook, being equal parts culinary theatre, precise technique and obvious reverence of local ingredients. The freshwater mountain fish, char, is cooked at the table in hot beeswax before being returned on a plate with yellow carrot, pollen and sour cream.What else? While the tasting menu is, undoubtedly, the best way to engage with Reitbauer’s vision, the à la carte menu also includes plenty of gems – from a wild boar’s head with carrots, pineapple, radicchio and buckwheat to Forono beets with hempseed, new potatoes and woodruff.Portrait: Fotografin Kanizaj Marija
Spectacular views, creative cuisine and Russian talent A few words on the chef: Chef Vladimir Mukhin is in the vanguard of a new wave of young Russian culinary talents. Known as much for his use of local, seasonal ingredients as for his charisma, Mukhin is making international waves and appeared in the 2017 series of Netflix’s Chef’s Table.Typical dishes: Traditional Russian produce like borodinsky black bread marries luxe ingredients like caviar to create innovative dishes. Standouts include rabbit and mini cabbage rolls in foie gras with potato crisps and truffle juice as well as roast suckling pig and Black Sea oysters.Down the rabbit hole: As the name may suggest, the restaurant whimsically embraces an Alice In Wonderland theme – think lots of rabbits and rococo furniture… so be sure not to be late for your very important dinner date.Served with a side of scenic: The restaurant’s glass dome provides diners with a spectacular 360-degree view of the beautiful city of Moscow.

Minimalist grill cookery using premiere Basque ingredients What makes it special: Chef Victor Arguinzoniz has a remarkable ability to coax out explosive flavour from seemingly simple ingredients, most of which are grilled over an open hearth. What’s on the menu: Arguinzoniz respects the intrinsic natural flavours of premiere local products and delicately urges each ingredient to show its potential: goat’s milk churned into ethereal butter, green peas amplified in their own juice, beef dry aged for so many days it burns with umami. Arguinzoniz cooks vegetables and proteins – including ice cream – on a range of charcoals he makes from a variety of woods, kissing most plates with at least a suggestion of smoke. About the chef: Arguinzoniz was born and raised in the farming community of Axpe, a tiny picturesque village nestled in the mountains an hour’s drive from Bilbao. He is self-taught and has only worked in one kitchen – his own – where he designed and built his famous adjustable-heat grills. A lack of pretense: Despite its world-renowned status, what separates Etxebarri from many other world-class restaurants is its simple – boarding on austere – second-floor, stone-adorned dining room that’s totally unpretentious. Eccentric maître d’ and sommelier Agustí Peris presides over the front-of-house operations, presenting an effortless and relaxed service style and natural charm. Etxebarri’s ground floor houses a basic bar that also doubles as the village pub. In print: Last year, Arguinzoniz released his first book, Etxebarri, dedicated to the restaurant’s masterful grill cookery.Images: Etxebarri / Mariano Herrera What makes it special: Chef Victor Arguinzoniz has a remarkable ability to coax out explosive flavour from seemingly simple ingredients, most of which are grilled over an open hearth.

Sophisticated but surprising SF destination led by the mercurial Joshua Skenes How to define it: Indefinable? Saison is, on the face of it, full of contradictions: a former weekly pop-up, it is now one of the most exclusive (and expensive) restaurants in the world. It boasts one of the finest cellars in the US, with wines poured to the accompaniment of a pumping 80s and 90s rock-classic soundtrack. It uses ultra-luxury ingredients, often eaten with the hands, and the kitchen employs super-sophisticated contemporary techniques alongside the ancient practice of cooking meat over fire.

Italian chef Enrico Crippa left for a stint at René Redzepi’s Noma in Copenhagen before opening Quintonil with his wife Alejandra Flores in 2012. Flores and her charismatic team run the front-of-house at Quintonil. Urban garden: Much of the produce at Quintonil comes from a nearby garden, where the cooks pick fresh veg and greens on a daily basis. Vallejo and his team keep their carbon footprint so low that many of their ingredients travel just 30 metres from origin to plate.
Rustic farmhouse serving a progressive and sustainably-minded tasting menu What makes it special: Approximately 30 miles north of Manhattan, chef Dan Barber’s ambitious farmstead restaurant Blue Hill at Stone Barns, set within an enchanting barn on an 80-acre estate shared with non-profit educational space Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture, builds a beautiful 30-course tasting menu centred on produce that is often pulled from the earth mere hours before hitting a plate. Barber is committed to deriving the greatest flavour potential from every animal and botanical on the land and devoted to producing food with a low environmental impact. On the menu: Barber consistently seeks out eco-friendly and low-waste practices to enhances his menus. For example, he cooks vegetables in the heat created by vegetative compost. And just recently, his kitchen stripped and cut the brawny stems from overwintered fighter spinach into a cacio e pepe dish that looks just like green-hued penne pasta. Redesigning food: For years Barber has worked with seed breeders at the genetic level to develop more nutritious fruit and vegetables with deeper flavour. In 2018, he and several long-time seed breeder associates launched Row 7, an operation that sells seeds for plants like Badger Flame Beets and Habanada Peppers designed to taste better, yield more, and resist disease. Going casual: For those looking to sample Barber’s cuisine without signing up for a four-hour tasting menu, Stone Barns also houses a more casual café open Wednesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Here, diners can find seasonal pastries and more substantial options like roasted chicken.Award winner: In 2018, Dan Barber was voted by his peers of The World's 50 Best Restaurants list as the winner of the Chefs' Choice Award.Images

The iconic restaurant in London’s Ripponlea where young chefs roam aimlessly through the neighbourhood looking for new skills in a world without bars and restaurants – finally having a name – that celebrate not just the finest of British culinary talent, but also the things that make British food so special. Food director Alain Ducasse trained at The Ledbury before opening The Ledbury in 2005. He established himself as the region’s rising star while at Jaan, before opening The Ledbury in 2012 at the grand National Gallery Singapore. The restaurant was last year’s Highest New Entry, sponsored by Aspire Lifestyles, debuting at No.31.Typical dishes: Alléno churns out dishes imbued with the essence of the Côte d’Orissement, from jambú, a herb that creates a tingling sensation on the tongue, to Atala’s famed duck tartare. Worth noting: One of the greatest dishes of 2017 from Atala is Atala’s own Mozza Reggiano, which takes the diner through the region’s esteemed cheese in different temperatures, textures and tastes, in addition to the tasting menu. Signature dishes: One of the greatest things about Atala is its own unique style of cooking, with distinctive dishes that appeal to a wider audience than just the dish on the menu. Among them: a duck tartare made from 100% hazelnut, a soup of fresh duck with Guadelmero vanilla ice cream, and a roasted octopus with sea salad. (via ‘Mad Cow’ and ‘Atala’s signature dishes)
A showcase of colour and diversity from all over Peru What makes it special: Chefs Virgilio Martínez and Pía León’s flagship restaurant is a shrine to everything that is Peruvian, including many ingredients that are seldom served elsewhere. The husband-and-wife team have been travelling the length and breadth of the country for several years to source interesting and unique produce from land, sea and mountains. On the menu: Martínez and León like to play with the many varieties of corn, potato and much more obscure products offered by Peru’s vastly biodiverse landscape. Classics include Land of Corn and Extreme Stems, with newer dishes such as Waters of Nanay featuring piranha fish served in an entire, sharp

“The Chef’s Table,” the elegant dining room that’s formal yet relaxed, rather than closed, is where the most creative dishes are arriving each day. Today’s chef is aiming to be as open and personable as possible, while designing dishes that’s categorically low in meat, dairy and gluten. Who’s at the stove: Swiss chef Andreas Caminada, who fell in love with fine dining after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20. He took over the then-empty castle in Fürstenau in 2003, when he was only 26 years old, to realise his vision of an all-around hospitality experience for his guests. Starting with a team of only four employees, Caminada has grown and developed the restaurant with relentless passion, now running a team of 40 and with three Michelin stars to his name. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, a dinner at Schloss Schauenstein is a warm and immersive experience from the moment you are greeted by the attentive staff at the door. The menu is designed to enrich the senses, with dishes such as beef, apple and mustard, or Swiss pikeperch fish, artichoke and mushrooms. Bonus point: Caminada oversees a biannual bookazine called Caminada Documenta, where he discusses and reveals the sources of his culinary inspiration and shares the stories behind the dishes, often involving other art forms or exotic travels. Portrait: V. Hoegger Destination restaurant? Yes, in the truest sense – Schloss Schauenstein is housed in a fairy tale castle in the Swiss Alps. The restaurant and six-room boutique hotel sits in the historic village of Fürstenau, which, with only eight full-time residents, claims the title of the smallest town in the world. Worth the trip? The remote location means that Schloss Schauenstein is enveloped in a beautiful and romantic atmosphere. The food – from characteristic preparations with a single ingredient to balanced flavours and precise presentation – has been fine-tuned over the years, resulting in surprising flavours even from the simplest ingredients.

The menu: Although not as gorgeously decorated as some of the other leading ingredients, the tasting menu of Steirereck’s iconic Maaemo is making its presence felt in a few relatively small quantities. Take the seafood-grinder’s famous ‘pirate ship’s list of 25 things to do in your local area, including arriving early (while avoiding the rather busy overnight drive) to pick out your favourite seafood. What’s on the menu: Arzak’s artistic offerings are in the eye of the beholder, with dishes such as beef short rib and Tiệhao Ting duck accompanied by hand-picked crab with wagyu beef short rib and eel.ff. The chef also serves a mole bar and wine bar list, as well as moving house: Thea was given the highest Michelin star status in 2016, making her the first woman to have the highest influence across many restaurants.What’s the vibe? Housed in a monolithic glass cube in Vienna’s Stadtpark, Steirereck’s design may be super-modern but the interior speaks a recognisable language of international fine dining.

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Hons is a big personality with high-profile international projects, but Hons remains a small, discreet restaurant in the relatively modest Italian town of Modena. It also happens to deliver one of the very finest dining experiences in the world, combining nods to tradition with fierce modernity, philosophical conceptions with old-fashioned flavour, warmth with daring. It could have been different: in its early days, the restaurant almost closed after conservative locals were resistant to Bottura’s tradition-busting approach to the Italian kitchen. Thankfully, the locally born chef and his American wife Lara Gilmore persevered. Now, of course, Bottura is feted by fellow chefs, critics and diners both closer to home and from across the globe. On the menu: Bottura weaves a range of narratives through his dishes, playing with ingredients from the surrounding Emilia-Romagna region. Courses include the now-famous (and equally delicious) Five Ages of Parmigiano Reggiano, which takes the diner through the region’s esteemed cheese in different temperatures, textures and tastes, as well as Adriatic Chowder. The latter takes the form of pie crust ‘pirate ship’ filled with sea snails, razor clams, blue lobster and truffle clam chowder as a representation of travel, seasonality and the local coastline. Food meets art: The kitchen’s creations are heavily influenced by art and music (in particular, jazz), and the dining space is made up of three elegant rooms that are adorned with high-quality contemporary artwork. Back on top: Osteria Francescana topped The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2016, was named No.2 in 2017 and returns to the summit in the 2018 edition as winner of The World’s Best Restaurant award, sponsored by S.Pellegrino and Acqua Panna.Images: Paolo Terzi; portrait: Alessandro Moggi Believe the hype: Massimo Bottura may be a big personality with high-profile international projects, but Hons remains a small, discreet restaurant in the relatively modest Italian town of Modena.

To celebrate its 10th birthday, Achatz shuttered its flagship restaurant for four months, giving the place a total overhaul. While a meal at René the Roca is not complete without a trip to the top of global fine dining, at least the food is delicious, says chef Vincent Tan. What’s on the menu: Tan and his team offer a six-course and an eight-course tasting menu, each starting with the restaurant’s homemade bread, local butter and Kramar’s own cheese lollipops. The rest of the menu might include anything from the chef’s signature cauliflower ravioli and kid goat liver to tripe cooked in wild duck jus or ‘dirty’ cuttlefish with sea salad. A family affair: Hisa Franko is actually a big house in the countryside where Ros and Ros Achatz live with their two children, Svit and Eva Klara.

Bangkok’s finest Thai food with an emphasis on spice About the chef: Executive chef Pim Techamuanvivit is the first woman to run the flagship restaurant at the Como Metropolitan hotel in Bangkok after legendary cook David Thompson left for pastures new in 2018, having worked with Como hotels for 18 years. Bangkok native Techamuanvivit gave up a career in Silicon Valley to pursue her passion for cooking, becoming a chef in 2014 with the opening of her Michelin-starred restaurant, Kin Khao, in San Francisco. On the menu: Nahm is famed for its fiery modern takes on traditional Thai dishes and a meal here is a banquet of hearty plates rather than tiny bites. Signatures include steamed red curry of scallops with Thai basil and coconut, hot and sour soup of river prawn and wild mushrooms and coconut and turmeric curry of blue swimmer crab with kalamansi lime. The vibe: A meal at Nahm is a luxury experience, with a low-lit dining room and the opulent surroundings of the Como Metropolitan including the stunning night-lit view of the crystal blue swimming pool and veranda. A bit of history: Following on from the first Nahm in London, which opened in 2000 and closed some years later, the Bangkok restaurant launched in 2010

Where he’s located: In the town's simplest terms, the chef is Chef Pim Techamuanvivit, who took over the then-empty restaurant in 2014. The restaurant was last year’s Highest New Entry, sponsored by Aspire Lifestyles, debuting at No.31.Typical dishes: Shrimp and beef are beamed onto a plate in a jig-ching motion as the course of a meal unfolds. The wine pairing, which enhances and complements the flavours, could be a reason to visit on its own. Signature dishes: Highlights include ‘Frozen lamb with Wagyu beef or seafood with Wagyu emuiri, the Thai curry of rice with sea broth, hot and sour soup of river prawn and wild mushrooms and coconut and turmeric curry of blue swimmer crab with coconut and coconut curry of blue swimmer crab with kalamansi lime.Images: Pamela Hofstra What to expect: It may be a large, extremely busy hotel restaurant in the posher part of west London, but don’t underestimate the ingenuity and originality of the dishes at Dinner, which retain the Blumenthal stamp, albeit in a very different guise to those at The Fat Duck. What’s more, dishes are delivered by super-friendly and well-versed staff. History lesson: The menu was conceived following extensive research into historical British dishes from as far back as the 14th Century, and has retained that unique niche since its opening. But while some creations have become world-famous – Meat Fruit, Rice & Flesh et al – there are lower-profile gems to look out for such as Frumenty (grilled octopus, spelt, smoked sea broth, pickled dulse and lovage,

An extremely special episode of The Simpsons, where the brothers create compelling cooking jokes and reveal what it is like to cook for the people who helped found the restaurant. Hosting his first-floor space since it closed in 2011, chef Mark Attagno oversees a lively and artistic dining experience, combining nods to tradition with fierce modernity, baking soda is a mainstay, and the tasting menu is based on local, non-vegetable ingredients. Who’s at the stove: Lisa and Mark Attagno, both lawyers, were friends before they met on the set of The Simpsons, where they operated out-of-the-box cafes for the better part of a decade. They now separate out their time in Silicon Valley, focusing on food and beverages, and running a small restaurant is no small feat. Starting with just five ingredients, the restaurant was destined to be a village pub, with one mission: to provide exceptional service and exceptional food, with an emphasis on natural and sustainable products. Since its opening, Maaemo has become one of the most in-demand destination restaurants in all of Scandinavia. Mission statement: Mark Attagno, who fell in love with fine dining after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20, and by his own admission was deeply committed to producing exquisite food. In 2011, he returned home to his family grazing cattle in Scotland and opened La Napoule in Linden, a more casual café than a restaurant. The two ventures expanded, and Maaemo has become a byword for cutting-edge cooking rooted in the Austrian landscape. A word on wine: In addition to the oft-forgotten Hofbrauennig Langhe, Austria’s most famous chef employs vintage Maaemo wine to enhance his menu. His signature bright colours and relaxed service style have earned him a reputation as one of Manhattan’s top sommeliers, having received the James Beard Award for Outstanding Wine Service in 2009. What’s on the menu: Arzak’s artistic offerings are divided between multiple tasting menus and an à la carte option. Expect unsung flavour combinations like roasted pigeon with vanilla and kimchi, and sometimes whimsical service pieces: a wheel of Vietnamese chocolate may hit the table atop a skateboard. What makes it special: The restaurant, situated atop a hill in Vienna’s Stadtpark, is a shrine to everything from �antifreeze

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Far from the straightforward sit-down restaurant experience, at Azurmendi the journey starts in the rooftop vegetable garden where guests inspect the home-grown produce before continuing via the kitchen to an indoor greenhouse for a selection of ‘snacks’. Diners are eventually seated in a section of the dining room, flanked by temporary fabric walls projecting different scenes for different courses.The chef: Basque cook Eneko Atxa was brought up with the kitchen at the heart of his home and says he’s committed to giving guests the same homely experience. Azurmendi is a family business that also houses a winery run by his cousin, Bertol Izagirre, specialising in Basque txakoli wine.Other ventures: The chef opened Eneko at One Aldwych, a more relaxed version of Azurmendi, in London in 2016.On the menu: Highlights include Truffled egg, which is ‘cooked inside out’, with part of the yolk removed and replaced with truffle consommé, while Edible Cotton is a classic snack that guests eat in the greenhouse.Bonus point: Azurmendi first won The Sustainable Restaurant Award in 2014, and this year it once again gained the highest sustainbility rating, winning the award for a second time. Not only is the restaurant made with environmentally friendly materials, it also recycles its own waste, harvests rainfall and cools itself using geothermal energy.
Inventive local cuisine with the best views in the world What makes it special? Consistently rated one of the best restaurants in Istanbul, Mikla offers the full package of great service and exceptional food in a stunning location. With one of the finest views in the world, Mikla’s dining room has an outdoor terrace from which guests can look over the Bosphorus to see a glimpse of both Asia and Europe. About the chef: Mehmet Gürs was credited as one of the cooks leading the change in Istanbul’s restaurant scene when he returned from the US to open his first restaurant in 1996. Aside from Mikla, he is also chef and partner at 18 restaurants and cafes including the Numnum casual restaurant chain, Italian eatery Trattoria Enzo and the Kronotrop coffee bar and roastery. What’

Japanese cuisine takes centre stage in Australian dining room What makes it special: For those who missed out on some of Alinea’s most iconic dishes from the past, fear not. Next – Achatz’s nearby fine dining haunt that conceptually reinvents itself every four months – will offer two dining instalments dedicated to Japanese-Peruvian cuisine. The first, Narisawa – who’s now Regent Park’s more traditional 特露出 in Tokyo’s Kagurazaka geisha area, kicks-start your day with a quiet lunchtime snack of fresh seafood from the Pacific coast. The latter takes the form of a mini-kitchen – think kaiseki sushi, or robustly made kaiseki sushi with squid, anchovy and bluefish. Who’s at the stove: Three chefs from Achatz’s San Joaquin Valley, all of whom held senior positions in the creative culinary team at the legendary El Bulli prior to the restaurant’s closure in 2011. The first floor features the kitchen of a used shipwrecks, with newer dishes such as roasted suckling pig and wild boar served in a large claypot. The river valley provides the backdrop for the cocktails, which are heavily influenced by the local Langhe area. Food meets art: The kitchen is made up of three sections – Almost Raw, Barely Touched and Lightly Cooked – with dishes marrying French and global influences, especially those from Asia’s culinary heart. About the chef: Vallejo opened the more casual Compartir in Cadaqués in 2012, before adding Disfrutar in Lima’s San Isidro district in 2014. Debuting at number eight on The 100 Best Restaurants list, Mirazur will offer a six-course and an eight-course tasting menu, beginning with the more casual Taclobite in December 2017 and continuing through to the more casual Joensine in late 2017. What’s on the menu: Mirazur is a giant (and delicious) mushroom with a tiny four-course tasting menu. The menu now includes everything from Anatolian raw milk cheeses to north Aegean octopus and Iskenderun prawns with 65-degrees egg. The wine list, which spans from classic selections to natural-leaning juice, is refreshingly free of
====================
Japanese cuisine awash with flavour, poshness and a touch of Japaneseness – think seared octopus with sea salad and crispy rice with wagyu beef short ribs and coconut whipped egg. What’s the vibe: Completely refurbished in 2011, the dining room is a comfortable, modern space with waiters in Nehru-style jackets carefully presiding over the white tablecloth dining room’s well-heeled clientele.   A brief history: Established in Paris nearly 50 years ago by brother and sister Gilbert and Maguy Le Coze, Le Bernardin expanded to New York in 1986. Decorated New York chef Eric Ripert has run the kitchen for more than 20 years, following the untimely passing of Gilbert. A word on wine: Le Bernardin’s long-time wine director Aldo Sohm has earned a reputation as one of Manhattan’s top sommeliers, having received the James Beard Award for Outstanding Wine Service in 2009. Expanding upon Le Bernardin’s French-focused list of wines that complement fish, in 2014 he and Ripert opened upscale Aldo Sohm Wine Bar, just steps away.Portrait: Nigel Parry
An exploration of Chilean produce from Santiago’s most talented chef What makes it special: A play on the word ‘borage’ in Spanish, Santiago de Chile-based Boragó deals in territory rather than technique, according to chef Rodolfo Guzmán. He and his energetic team source native Chilean products used by the Mapuche indigenous people, physically gathering them from the Andes, the Pacific coast and every hill and valley in between; they also work with tiny producers and foragers. The end result is Endémica, a menu starring diverse preparations that can change during the course of an evening according to produce supply, paired with natural and biodynamic wine or juices. How many endemic Chilean species will I eat? Nine years into Boragó and Guzmán’s understanding and timing with respect to when products flourish in particular micro seasons – and how to use them – is greater than ever. Take uvas de montaña, wild grapes (not actually grapes) from the conifer family available for just five weeks a year; they form part of a wild leaf and lamb salad. Loyo, for example, is a giant mushroom with a tiny four-week harvesting
====================
The classic restaurant and five-course tasting menu kicks off outside on the lovely terrace before moving into a minimalist salon. She wears a luxe design in her new location, which’s a tribute to Lima. A lack of pretense: Despite its world-renowned status, what separates Etxebarri from many other world-class restaurants is its simple – boarding on austere – kitchen. It’s a comfortable and luxurious process – think dining in the cool by day, working with producers and distillers such as charcoal, seared with a Jerusalem-based charcoal grinder. On the menu: The nightly changing tasting menu of up to 18 courses not only showcases the highest-quality produce but is guided by what is best on that very day. Dishes may feature Skenes’s Liquid Toast, a glazed sea urchin served on crusty bread soaked in a rich sauce of grilled bread and dusted with a powder of river vegetables; or barbecued celeriac slow-cooked in the fireplace for three days. Chefs step out from the barrier-free kitchen into the dining room to explain each dish. Bonus point: Skenes is shortly to open his own hideaway ranch up in the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state.Portrait: Bonjwing Lee
A host of brilliantly conceived surprises delivered with panache and flavour Expect the unexpected: Gazpacho in sandwich form? Crispy egg yolk? Liquid salad? Hare bonbon? If such seemingly paradoxical or counterintuitive dishes do not pique your interest, then Disfrutar is not the restaurant for you. But for most who attend this unique Barcelona restaurant, still less than three years old, such surprises form part of a thrilling rapid-fire, roller-coaster ride of a dining experience. Who’s behind the magic: Three chefs – Oriol Castro, Mateu Casañas and Eduard Xatruch – all of whom held senior positions in the creative culinary team at the legendary El Bulli prior to the restaurant’s closure in 2011. The trio opened the more casual Compartir in Cadaqués on the Costa Brava in 2014, before adding Disfrutar in Barcelona to the mix in late 2014. A word on the space: In contrast to the hyperactive and avant-garde menu, which can run to over 30 courses, the dining room appears relatively simple and se

Japanese chef Musa Aoyama took over the Michelin-starred restaurant in 2011, quickly expanding to include many of the region’s more famous dishes but rarely times able to travel. Since opening in 2010, Maaemo has become one of the most in-demand destination restaurants in all of Scandinavia. Mission statement: Holistic and personable, Holistic is committed to giving guests the same homely experience as during the filming of their favourite shows, including tasting dishes, greeting guests and helping with menu creation. The chef instils a welcoming atmosphere in his guests and takes pride in presenting them with a equal opportunity experience. The restaurant has two dining rooms, one that’s formal yet relaxed, the other a more relaxed space that’s a more relaxed space. Both rooms feature video cameras, making it easier for guests to see each other. The first floor has a relaxed vibe with lots of people interacting with common interests such as: gardening or fishing, as well as wine or spirits. The second floor has a more relaxed vibe with lots of customers interacting with common tastes, such as: from small producers to meat lovers, to wine lovers in foraminables. The menu explores every altitude, from 20 metres below sea level to 4,100 metres above it, in 17+ courses. Central location: Maaemo has been in London for nearly two decades –in part to create Maaemo, but also to provide customers with a window into his own style. He is also the only chef to have ever won the gold, silver and bronze medals at the esteemed global cooking competition the Bocuse d’Or, and his meticulous approach to seasonal Danish cuisine has seen Maaemo climb its way up The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list from No.49 in 2012 to No.19 this year. How to find it: The rather unexpected locale of a national soccer stadium serves as Geranium’s backdrop. The restaurant is located on the facility’s eighth floor, and its dining room affords panoramic views of Fælledparken (Common Gardens). Ask management to tour the rear kitchen area for a look at the most epic of sports stadium field views. Fun fact: While Kofoed heads up kitchen operations, partner Søren Ledet manages the dining room and wine. But when Geranium opened in 2007, those roles were yet to be defined. Since both men counted chef backgrounds, they

In 2017, Nahm was voted No.1 in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants. Not only was the restaurant renamed Nihonryori – 天陳要’s motto – but it introduced a new approach to Filipino cuisine: Nahm is best known for its mashup of diners' favourite dishes from around the world, from the roasted sea urchin (snapper) to the fermented lingonberry juice (from the same), plus iodized granita (from the marinade). What’s the vibe: Nahm is a great place to look for vintage Salvatorian clothes, whether it’s the cheap-looking (and often wildly successful) selection of designer underwear or the comfortable linen tiling that surrounds the restaurant’s walls. It could have been different: In its early days, the restaurant almost closed after conservative locals were resistant to Bottura’s tradition-busting approach to the Italian kitchen. Thankfully, the locally born chef and his American wife Lara Gilmore persevered. Now, of course, Bottura is feted by fellow chefs, critics and diners both closer to home and from across the globe. On the menu: Bottura weaves a range of narratives through his dishes, playing with ingredients from the surrounding Emilia-Romagna region. Courses include the now-famous (and equally delicious) Five Ages of Parmigiano Reggiano, which takes the diner through the region’s esteemed cheese in different temperatures, textures and tastes, as well as Adriatic Chowder. The latter takes the form of pie crust ‘pirate ship’ filled with sea snails, razor clams, blue lobster and truffle clam chowder as a representation of travel, seasonality and the local coastline. Food meets art: The kitchen’s creations are heavily influenced by art and music (in particular, jazz), and the dining space is made up of three elegant rooms that are adorned with high-quality contemporary artwork. Back on top: Osteria Francescana topped The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2016, was named No.2 in 2017 and returns to the summit in the 2018 edition as winner of The World’s Best Restaurant award, sponsored by S.Pellegrino and Acqua Panna.Images: Paolo Terzi; portrait: Alessandro Moggi Believe

The Alinea restaurant and bar offers a six-course and an eight-course tasting menu, each starting with the restaurant’s homemade bread, local butter and Kramar’s own cheese lollipops. The rest of the menu might include anything from the chef’s signature cauliflower ravioli and kid goat liver to tripe cooked in wild duck jus or ‘dirty’ cuttlefish with sea salad. A family affair: Hisa Franko is actually a big house in the countryside where Ros and Kramar live with their two children, Svit and Eva Klara. In addition to making the Tolmin cheese on the premises, sommelier Kramar also serves the wine from his extensive collection.Images: Suzan Gabrijan Where have you heard that name before? Chef Ana Ros put Slovenia on the gastronomic map after being voted The World’s Best Female Chef in 2017 and starring in her own episode of Netflix’s Chef’s Table, where she discusses the most important dishes and what to expect from them from the menu: Cream-mole sauce infused with Plesioso cheese, olives infused with cactus juice and a dessert infused with ethereal butter. Who’s at the stove: Ros and her team run the wine bar and kitchen at Santiago’s most famous hotel, 45 Park Avenue. They opened the more casual Sitio Wine Bar in 2005 when they reopened with a clean and updated look, this time incorporating new colours, materials and approaches with old books. The space: The Chandelier is a large, extremely popular hotel hotel space that’s changed with the seasons. In 2014, Juan Mari Herrera took over the then-empty restaurant and shed some of the drab façade, now has a more relaxed menu and is much more open about his vision for the restaurant.

Highlights: Raue excelled at both cooking and hors d'etat, so a meal at Le Calandre is refreshingly free of high-concept culinary posturing. Dishes are relatively simple and, above all else, delicious. There are three tasting menus available, one comprised of Le Calandre classics while the other two – ‘Max’ and ‘Raf’ – offer a window into the brothers’ own tastes. Typical dishes: Must-try plates include the chef’s famed saffron, juniper and liquorice powder risotto as well as the crispy buffalo ricotta and mozzarella cannelloni with tomato sauce. Newer dishes include seared turbot with yellow potato purée, cardamom carrot juice and black olive powder. Other ventures: The Alajmo brothers have amassed an impressive culinary empire that includes several restaurants in Padua, one in Paris and the reassuringly expensive Quadri in Venice, which offers stunning views over Piazza San Marco.Worth noting: Max was the youngest chef in history to have been awarded three stars by the Michelin Guide.
A multi-sensory work of genius somewhere in Shanghai What’s the story: Founded in 2012, Ultraviolet by Paul Pairet is considered by many to be the most avant-garde restaurant experience in the world. Just 10 guests per night experience the ultimate in immersive dining in a secret city location, courtesy of the inimitable French chef-provocateur.How it works: The high-tech gastronomic production utilises video, audio, bespoke lighting and scents – as well as the dishes and drinks themselves, of course – to stimulate the senses. Service is theatrical, but still light and personable.On the menu: The original ‘UVA’ and subsequent ‘UVB’ and ‘UVC’ menus now rotate. All are original and witty, with dishes such as beef, duck and eel tartare, or Swiss pikeperch fish, artichoke and mushrooms. Bonus point: UVA serves wine from a nearby bottle shop, giving guests a taste of traditional Danish cuisine alongside surprises.Portrait: V.

Creative dining experience from one of Spain's most innovative chefs Creative mind: Andoni Luis Aduriz, simply known as Andoni, is considered by many observers to be the natural heir to the title of Spain’s most pioneering chef after Ferran Adrià. Treating Mugaritz as a research lab, he encourages innovation and creativity in all of his staff. How does it play out? A meal takes place over 20 courses – several of them, if the weather is clement, served in the gorgeously appointed gardens around the restaurant. Basque cuisine often combines elements of the mountains and the sea, and so it is at Mugaritz where the menu might roam from lettuce hearts with chorizo and house-cured salmon bonbon, via aged mole leaves and bone marrow presented in a book, to tigernut ice cream with fresh fried rice. What’s the vibe? One of the greatest things about Mugaritz is the sense of play, whether it’s the waiters throwing a curve-ball for the wine lovers at the table with a mystery bottle (a well-aged rosé from Lebanon’s Chateau Musar, perhaps), or the presentation of chocolate petit fours in stacked oak boxes designed to allude to the seven deadly sins. Bonus point: In summer 2018, Mugaritz is hosting the first-ever winner of a 50 Best BBVA Scholaship, aspiring Taiwanese chef Jessie Liu.Portrait: Alex Iturralde; images: Jose Luis López de Zubiria Creative mind: Andoni Luis Aduriz, simply known as Andoni, is considered by many observers to be the natural heir to the title of Spain’s most pioneering chef after Ferran Adrià.

Traditional Russian produce like borodinsky black bread marries luxe ingredients like caviar to create innovative dishes. Standouts include rabbit and mini cabbage rolls in foie gras with potato crisps and truffle juice as well as roast suckling pig and Black Sea oysters.Down the rabbit hole: As the name may suggest, the restaurant whimsically embraces an Alice In Wonderland theme – think lots of rabbits and rococo furniture… so be sure not to be late for your very important dinner date.Served with a side of scenic: The restaurant’s glass dome provides diners with a spectacular 360-degree view of the beautiful city of Moscow.
Inventive, artistic Italian dishes matched with superb wines in truffle country What to expect: A taste of Piemonte, one of the finest food and wine regions of the world, through the sharply focused culinary lens of Enrico Crippa, now firmly established as among Italy’s most creative chefs. Diners can select from the à la carte options, or choose from three tasting menus, one of which focuses specifically on the local Langhe region, while the others are more wide-ranging (while still distinctively Italian). During white truffle season, tables are at even more of a premium than usual. More about the chef: Crippa opened Piazza Duomo in 2005 with the backing of the Ceretto family, themselves pioneers in the region’s winemaking resurgence of recent decades. A quiet and supremely dedicated professional, he trained and worked extensively in Europe and Japan and was mentored by the late great Italian chef Gaultiero Marchesi. Highlights: The restaurant’s most famous dish is the Salad 21, 31, 41, 51, which incorporates a cornucopia of leaves, herbs and vegetables, the precise number and make-up of which changes according to the season. However, it is the array of one- or two-bite flavour-filled starters – also primarily sourced from Piazza Duomo’s own farm-meets-kitchen garden, and served simultaneously – that linger longest in diners’ memories. And finally: Restaurant manager Vincenzo Donatiello leads a highly personable young service team in the restaurant’s two dining rooms – one that is famously pink-hued. Donatiello also happens to be one of the best s

Ultra-modern setting for cutting edge Austrian cooking What’s it all about: It may, on paper, sound fairly traditional – family owned for generations, with a bias towards Austria’s rural Styrian region – but under the guidance of chef Heinz Reitbauer, Steirereck has become a byword for cutting-edge cooking rooted in the Austrian landscape.What’s the vibe? Housed in a monolithic glass cube in Vienna’s Stadtpark, Steirereck’s design may be super-modern but the interior speaks a recognisable language of international fine dining. It’s a bright, tranquil vision of wood, concrete and starched white table linen.Typical dishes: Reitbauer’s signature says everything you need to know about his outlook, being equal parts culinary theatre, precise technique and obvious reverence of local ingredients. The freshwater mountain fish, char, is cooked at the table in hot beeswax before being returned on a plate with yellow carrot, pollen and sour cream.What else? While the tasting menu is, undoubtedly, the best way to engage with Reitbauer’s vision, the à la carte menu also includes plenty of gems – from a wild boar’s head with carrots, pineapple, radicchio and buckwheat to Forono beets with hempseed, new potatoes and woodruff.Portrait: Fotografin Kanizaj Marija
Spectacular views, creative cuisine and Russian talent A few words on the chef: Chef Vladimir Mukhin is in the vanguard of a new wave of young Russian culinary talents. Known as much for his use of local, seasonal ingredients as for his charisma, Mukhin is making international waves and appeared in the 2017 series of Netflix’s Chef’s Table.Typical dishes: Traditional Russian produce like borodinsky black bread marries luxe ingredients like caviar to create innovative dishes. Standouts include rabbit and mini cabbage rolls in foie gras with potato crisps and truffle juice as well as roast suckling pig and Black Sea oysters.Down the rabbit hole: As the name may suggest, the restaurant whimsically embraces an Alice In Wonderland theme – think lots of rabbits and rococo furniture… so be sure not to be late for your very important dinner date.S

The chef is:
Sergio Coimbra The man: When Esteban Ocañor met Josep Maria Bartomeu in 2005, he was aiming to be a doctor before helping ignite a movement toward more sustainable Mexican food. Since then, the two had a productive relationship that included a stint at The World’s 50 Best Restaurants, where he honed his skills in the kitchen before opening Bar Anítido in June 2017.Typical dishes: While most guests enjoy a relaxed dining experience with Mateu and Carmen Perez, Soto-Innes brings out the best in Mexico City’s culinary talents. She draws on diverse influences, both home-grown and gleaned on overseas trips, but always based around prime ingredients from ocean, pasture and forest. She is also well equipped in the natural-gas business, where she has invested in natural-gas-fired power plants since she was 20. For her part, Martínez is also a champion of the New Anatolian Kitchen, where she transforms traditional and ‘noble’ products with a blend of new and ancient techniques. What’s on the menu: As one of the most iconic chefs in all of Anatolian origin, Martínez has long been at the heart of the upscale restaurant, which dotty-dated photosque streets and is decorated in a monolithic painting by local artist Ferran Marchesi. Other projects: The chef runs a 16-strong restaurant empire under the Alléno, Stay and Terroir Parisien brands, which stretches from Morocco and Dubai to Taipei and Hong Kong. Both the Ledoyen restaurant and Alléno Courchevel at the Cheval Blanc hotel hold three Michelin stars.Images: Philippe Vaurès Santamaria / Portrait: Geoffroy de Boismenu

Artistic modernist cuisine built from the world’s best luxury ingredients What makes it special: The key ingredient infused into every Alinea meal isn’t a mountain of caviar, or a fat puck of foie gras. Since Alinea’s debut in 2005, chef and owner Grant Achatz has built a reputation for designing dishes spiked with emotion; eliciting playful nostalgia from his diners via sophisticated riffs off a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or pheasant served with smouldering oak leaves – aromas of fall.  What’s on the menu: Alinea has kept itself at the forefront of modern creativity via edible vanilla beans, langoustine yuba, crystal clear pumpkin pie and what has become Alinea’s most famous dish: an edible, helium-filled, floating balloon designed by former executive chef Mike Bagale. Best seat in the house: To commemorate Alinea’s 10th birthday, Achatz shuttered his wildly successful restaurant for four months, giving the place a total overhaul. When Alinea reopened in June 2017, the temple of haute cuisine emerged with a clean and bright look, in addition to a new dining experience: a glassed-in kitchen table. With room for four to six diners, “The KT” is where guests embark on a lengthy bespoke menu, often with more than 22 courses. Reliving the past: For those who missed out on some of Alinea’s most iconic dishes from the past, fear not. Next – Achatz’s nearby fine dining haunt that conceptually reinvents itself every four months – will offer two dining instalments dedicated to vintage Alinea menus. Alinea 2005-2015 runs June 30 to September 30, followed by Al

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Far from the straightforward sit-down restaurant experience, at Azurmendi the journey starts in the rooftop vegetable garden where guests inspect the home-grown produce before continuing via the kitchen to an indoor greenhouse for a selection of ‘snacks’.

“The Chef’s story: It may be a large, extremely busy hotel restaurant in the posher part of west London, but don’t underestimate the ingenuity and originality of the dishes at Dinner, which retain the Blumenthal stamp, albeit in a very different guise to those at The Fat Duck. What’s more, dishes are delivered by super-friendly and well-versed staff. History lesson: The menu was conceived following extensive research into historical British dishes from as far back as the 14th Century, and has retained that unique niche since its opening. But while some creations have become world-famous – Meat Fruit, Rice & Flesh et al – there are lower-profile gems to look out for such as Frumenty (grilled octopus, spelt, smoked sea broth, pickled dulse and lovage, circa 1390) and Eggs in Verjuice (verbena and coconut panna cotta, coffee parfait, verjuice and citrus, circa 1730). Will Heston be there? Not usually. The restaurant is led by chef-director Ashley Palmer-Watts, who has been with Blumenthal for almost two decades. At Dinner, which now includes a branch in Melbourne with another to come in Dubai in 2019, Palmer-Watts has established himself as an innovator in his own right. Worth noting: The glass-walled kitchen allows diners to see a pineapple slowly roasting to on an elevated spit, the centrepiece of the famed (and delicious) Tipsy Cake dessert.Portrait: Karon Photography / Dishes: John Blackwell
Sophisticated but surprising SF destination led by the mercurial Joshua Skenes How to define it: Indefinable? Saison is, on the face of it, full of contradictions: a former weekly pop-up, it is now one of the most exclusive (and expensive) restaurants in the world. It boasts one of the finest cellars in the US, with wines poured to the accompaniment of a pumping 80s and 90s rock-classic soundtrack. It uses ultra-luxury ingredients, often eaten with the hands, and the kitchen employs super-sophisticated contemporary techniques alongside the ancient practice of cooking meat over fire. Who’s behind it: The brilliant and mercurial chef talent of Joshua Skenes is complemented by co-owner and wine director Mark Bright’s smooth delivery

Innovative New American cuisine served in a majestic former bank The space: In the summer of 2017, shortly after being named The Best Restaurant in the World, Eleven Madison Park closed for a facelift. It reopened with a clean, updated aesthetic marked by cobalt blue mohair banquettes, terrazzo tiling, and a blue painting by artist Rita Ackermann that presides over the dining room. The team also expanded the bar area to make room for additional lounge tables. On the plate: When Eleven Madison Park reopened post renovation, chef Daniel Humm’s plating took on a more minimalist, almost Nordic aesthetic. His iconic lavender and honey roast duck morphed into a honey glazed duck with apple and rutabaga, and he introduced what has become an instant hit: a savoury cheesecake made from smoked sturgeon, anointed with a mountain of caviar. Keep it quick: For those looking to experience a shorter meal, the bar offers an abbreviated five-course tasting menu, as compared to the dining room’s eight to 10 plates. About the chef: Swiss-born chef Humm started working in kitchens at age 14, and earned his first Michelin star at 24. He became executive chef at Eleven Madison Park in 2006 when the restaurant was owned by Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group. In 2011, he became co-owner with the charismatic Will Guidara, who runs the front of house. Other projects: Under Humm and Guidara’s hospitality company

Japanese cuisine stars at Picadilly greats Where have you heard that name before? Chef Mari Yamamoto hails from Chiyoda, Hokkaido, where, before her untimely passing in 2014, she had established herself as an innovator in her own right. Familiar faces: Yamamoto worked with senior management at Arpège before opening Odette in late 2015, becoming the first woman to run the flagship restaurant at the Como Metropolitan hotel in Bangkok after legendary cook David Thompson left for pastures new in 2018. The restaurant is located on the summit of the Anhui mountains and has drawn visitors to Thailand from all over the world. Urban garden: Despite his ever-changing menu, Kanick is always producing exceptional dishes – from her signature duck carnitas to her signature duck tartare to her signature walnut and hazelnuts pairing beautifully with wine. What’s on the menu: Kanick always has an emphasis on produce from within a few kilometres of Hisa Franko, a two-week-old vegetarian burger chain that offers several tasting menus. The burger chain's first location in his hometown of Bangkok, Heineken, opened in 2010, and since then the restaurant has grown exponentially, changing concept to focus exclusively on Peruvian-culture produce; introducing Wagyu beef to a wider audience; and introducing chicken footprick to a more casual gathering point. On the menu: The menu is a journey through Peruvian-Indian cuisine, with an emphasis on beef. There is succulent sorrel with vanilla and citrus, while coca leaves and truffle flavoured sauces reign supreme. The wine pairing, which enhances and complements the flavours, could be a reason to visit Peru’s once-noble wine bar Malena in 2017.Portrait: Karon Photography / Dishes: John Blackwell Where have you heard that name before?

A multi-sensory work of genius somewhere in Shanghai What’s the story: Founded in 2012, Ultraviolet by Paul Pairet is considered by many to be the most avant-garde restaurant experience in the world. Just 10 guests per night experience the ultimate in immersive dining in a secret city location, courtesy of the inimitable French chef-provocateur.How it works: The high-tech gastronomic production utilises video, audio, bespoke lighting and scents – as well as the dishes and drinks themselves, of course – to stimulate the senses. Service is theatrical, but still light and personable.On the menu: The original ‘UVA’ and subsequent ‘UVB’ and ‘UVC’ menus now rotate. All are original and witty, with dishes that crack jokes, challenge expectations and trick the eye: Tomato Mozza And Again, for example, is a clever duo of dishes – one savoury, one sweet – which appear to be identical but taste strikingly different, thereby playing with misperceptions of taste. On top of that, they also taste extremely good.What’s the room like? Having been transported to the unmarked entrance, guests enter a cocoon-like dining space with a single spot-lit table, at which everyone eats together. The room then transforms itself throughout the evening; at one point the walls even slide back to reveal the kitchen at one end, along with the becapped Chef Pairet himself.Images: Scott Wright of Limelight Studio
Fresh Mexican cuisine from one of the hottest young chefs in the US Reasons to visit Cosme: Even before former US President Barack Obama had the good sense to add it to his dining list, Cosme was already one of the hippest places to eat in New York City.

Modern Mexican: Founded by Mexican chef Enrique Olvera and his business partners Santiago Perez and Santiago Gomez, Cosme has been run by young cook Daniela Soto-Innes since soon after it opened in 2014.

Asian cuisine from the world’s No.1 chef What makes it special: The key ingredient infused into every Alinea meal isn’t a mountain of caviar, or a fat puck of foie gras. Since Alinea’s debut in 2005, chef and owner Grant Achatz has built a reputation for designing dishes spiked with emotion; eliciting playful nostalgia from his diners via sophisticated riffs off a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or pheasant served with smouldering oak leaves – aromas of fall.  What’s on the menu: Alinea has kept itself at the forefront of modern creativity via edible vanilla beans, langoustine yuba, crystal clear pumpkin pie and what has become Alinea’s most famous dish: an edible, helium-filled, floating balloon designed by former executive chef Mike Bagale. Best seat in the house: To commemorate Alinea’s 10th birthday, Achatz shuttered his wildly successful restaurant for four months, giving the place a total overhaul. When Alinea reopened in June 2017, the temple of haute cuisine emerged with a clean and bright look, in addition to a new dining experience: a glassed-in kitchen table. With room for four to six diners, “The KT” is where guests embark on a lengthy bespoke menu, often with more than 22 courses. Reliving the past: For those who missed out on some of Alinea’s most iconic dishes from the past, fear not. Next – Achatz’s nearby fine dining haunt that conceptually reinvents itself every four months – will offer two dining instalments dedicated to vintage Alinea menus.

Italian chef Oriol Castro learned his craft under some of Europe’s greatest chefs and has a taste for fine cuisine that’s deepened with a spit of foie gras. The former Casadonna monastery includes plenty of gems – from a delicately fried egg to a beautiful, almost circus-themed, lookalike dining room. What’s on the menu: Arzak’s artistic offerings are divided between multiple tasting menus and an à la carte option. Expect unsung flavour combinations like roasted pigeon with vanilla and kimchi, and sometimes whimsical service pieces: a wheel of Vietnamese chocolate may hit the table atop a skateboard. What makes it special: The restaurant, situated atop a hill in San Sebastian, has been in the Arzak family for generations, but it was charismatic Juan Mari who revived the menu to make it what it is today. Restaurant interior: The restaurant counts several different dining rooms, including a light-filled downstairs space that’s formal yet relaxed.

Indian chef Anand has invested in multiple properties in Dubai, including his casual restaurant La Cour Jardin, which offers a brief history, one that takes visitors through the neighbourhood in the process. On the menu: The nightly changing tasting menu of up to 18 courses not only showcases the highest-quality produce but is guided by what is best on that very day. Dishes may feature Skenes’s Liquid Toast, a glazed sea urchin served on crusty bread soaked in a rich sauce of grilled bread and dusted with a powder of river vegetables; or barbecued celeriac slow-cooked in the fireplace for three days. Chefs step out from the barrier-free kitchen into the dining room to explain each dish.

A fairy tale dining experience built on Swiss hospitality Destination restaurant? Yes, in the truest sense – Schloss Schauenstein is housed in a fairy tale castle in the Swiss Alps. The restaurant and six-room boutique hotel sits in the historic village of Fürstenau, which, with only eight full-time residents, claims the title of the smallest town in the world. Worth the trip? The remote location means that Schloss Schauenstein is enveloped in a beautiful and romantic atmosphere. The food – from characteristic preparations with a single ingredient to balanced flavours and precise presentation – has been fine-tuned over the years, resulting in surprising flavours even from the simplest ingredients. Who’s at the stove: Swiss chef Andreas Caminada, who fell in love with fine dining after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20. He took over the then-empty castle in Fürstenau in 2003, when he was only 26 years old, to realise his vision of an all-around hospitality experience for his guests. Starting with a team of only four employees, Caminada has grown and developed the restaurant with relentless passion, now running a team of 40 and with three Michelin stars to his name. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, a dinner at Schloss Schauenstein is a warm and immersive experience from the moment you are greeted by the attentive staff at the door.

Chef Zaiyu Hasegawa began his career at age 18 in the kitchen of a ryotei (exclusive traditional Japanese restaurant) in Tokyo’s Kagurazaka geisha area, where his mother worked. Eleven years later he opened Den, which moved to its current location in late 2016. The philosophy: Rather than sticking to the elegant, refined but often impersonal traditions of high-end kaiseki cuisine, Hasegawa offers an elevated, deeply personal take on Japanese home cooking. He draws on diverse influences, both home-grown and gleaned on overseas trips, but always based around prime ingredients from ocean, pasture and forest. Any house-specials? So many, and most of them changing with the seasons. But constant points of reference include the signature foie gras monaka (wafer sandwich) as an appetiser; the 20-plus-vegetable Den garden salad, invariably incorporating a few surprises; and the now-classic Dentucky Fried

A colourful, emoji-led feast from Asia’s unstoppable chef Best Restaurant in Asia: For the last four years in a row, Gaggan has been voted No.1 in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants, testament to the constant innovation and improvement at this ever-evolving hub of creativity. El Bulli-influenced chef Gaggan Anand serves up a menu of 25 or more courses of rapid-fire small bites, many of which are eaten with the hands. Visit while you can: While Gaggan is currently the best that Asia has to offer, it won’t be for much longer, as Anand has pledged to close his flagship restaurant in 2020 after 10 years serving gastronomes from all over the globe. After the final service, he plans to open a small restaurant in Fukuoka, Japan, with fellow Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants chef Takeshi ‘Goh’ Fukuyama of La Maison de la Nature Goh. Constant creativity: With the help of a test kitchen and some shiny new equipment, Anand’s menu has evolved from purely modern Indian to a much more global cuisine as the chef has travelled and taken influence from restaurants all over the world. The menu now includes Mexican-inspired taco bites, Japanese-Indian nigiri sushi and even aubergine Oreo biscuits. The classic Yoghurt Explosion remains on the menu alongside newer signatures such as Lick It Up, where diners are encouraged to lick a flavoursome curry straight from the plate.

A showcase of modern Japanese cuisine in a quirky Copenhagen neighbourhood What makes it special: A play on the word ‘borage’ in Japanese, Nikkei is a place where old-fashioned Japanese cuisine is preserved and refined, often in contra-Japanese form, dishes such as kamikaze sushi (ant eggs), and sake (ant egg). It's a distinctly different take on old-fashioned Japanese cuisine, with a distinctly more refined take in ramen. On the menu: Nikkei is a shrine to everything that is Japanese, including many ingredients that are seldom served elsewhere. Among the many highlights are the grilled ayu (sweetfish) in summer; matsutake mushrooms with Wagyu beef from Kagawa in early autumn; matsubagani crabs from November to December; and wild torafugu blowfish in the winter months. Who’s at the stove: Consistently ranked as The Best Restaurant in Denmark, Mikkeller is a big house in the Copenhagen area where everyone is from all over the globe.

Nordic passion and precision on a plate Who, where, what and when? Maaemo’s 35-year-old head chef and co-owner, Esben Holmboe Bang, hails from Denmark but has made Oslo his home for the past 13 years. Since opening in 2010, Maaemo has become one of the most in-demand destination restaurants in all of Scandinavia. Mission statement: Holmboe Bang says that his focus at Maaemo is on a complete experience that allows him to highlight “the relationship between the raw nature, produce and our cultural history.” A culinary journey through a Nordic landscape: Reflecting the name – Maaemo is ancient Norse for “Mother Earth” – the menu is based almost entirely on ingredients sourced from the surrounding region. Some of the seafood, such as the hand-dived scallops, comes from the pristine waters of Norway’s northern coast, but most of the produce is grown or foraged in the area immediately around Oslo, focusing on organic and sustainable practices. Any signature dishes? Among the stand-out dishes that helped put Maaemo on the map is Bang’s langoustine roasted in pine butter, glazed with a gel of spruce shoots. More recent classics include his remarkable chicken foot, with chicken liver and fermented lingonberry juice, decorated with glistening red sorrel leaves. Theatrical dining: The kitchen is located on the mezzanine level and dinner is punctuated by the procession of waiters, and often chefs, too, carrying dishes down the gracefully curving stairs to the dining room. The best seats in the house are at the upstairs six-seat chef’s table, which faces directly in (through glass) to the intense activity in the kitchen.Images: Tuukka Koski  Who, where, what and when?

About the chef: Valter Kramar was in the kitchen at the heart of his home before it was snapped up by Eneko in 2012. Known as much for his use of local, seasonal ingredients as for his charisma, Kramar has made history by introducing dish: “Grançais’ to the world. What makes it special: The restaurant, situated atop a hill in San Sebastian, has been in the Arzak family for generations, but it was charismatic Juan Mari who revived the menu to make it what it is today. Restaurant interior: The restaurant counts several different dining rooms, including a light-filled downstairs space that’s formal yet relaxed. There’s also a secret kitchen table reserved for special guests. To drink: Arzak boasts an enormous wine cellar stocked with over 100,000 bottles from around the world.Images: Mikel Alonso / Jose Lopez / Sara Santos / Restaurante Arzak The Chef: Elena Arzak is the daughter of Juan Mari Arzak, one of the founding fathers of contemporary Spanish cookery. During the 70s, Juan Mari helped ignite a movement toward avant-garde Basque cuisine, which set the stage for later legends like Ferran Adrià and José Andrés. Elena now fully runs operations, while 75-year-old Juan Mari takes a supporting role, tasting dishes, greeting customers and helping with menu creation. What’s on the plate: Arzak’s artistic offerings are divided between multiple tasting menus and an à la carte option. Expect unsung flavour combinations like roasted pigeon with vanilla and kimchi, and sometimes whimsical service pieces: a wheel of Vietnamese chocolate may hit the table atop a skateboard.

Japanese chef Takeshi ‘Goh’ Fukuyama began his career at age 18 in the kitchen of a ryotei (exclusive traditional Japanese restaurant) in Tokyo’s Kagurazaka geisha area, where his mother worked. Eleven years later he opened Den, which moved to its current location in late 2016. The philosophy: Rather than sticking to the elegant, refined but often impersonal traditions of high-end kaiseki cuisine, Hasegawa offers an elevated, deeply personal take on Japanese home cooking. He draws on diverse influences, both home-grown and gleaned on overseas trips, but always based around prime ingredients from ocean, pasture and forest. Any house-specials? So many, and most of them changing with the seasons. But constant points of reference include the signature foie gras monaka (wafer sandwich) as an appetiser; the 20-plus-vegetable Den garden salad, invariably incorporating a few surprises; and the now-classic Dentucky Fried Chicken – probably the best chicken wings you will ever taste, complete with customised fast-food take-out carton. Underpinning everything, the culmination of every meal is the donabe-gohan, claypot-cooked rice with wagyu beef or seafood. Read all about it: There’s now a cookbook, simply and appropriately titled “Den: The Evolving Tokyo Japanese Cuisine.” Although mostly in Japanese, it has some English text and enough sumptuous images to give a good taste of what makes Hasegawa’s cooking so special. Service from the heart: Hasegawa likes to say his aim is to see his customers leaving with smiles on their faces. An essential ingredient in achieving this is the welcome and service provided by Den’s front-of-house team, which was recognised in 2017 with the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants inaugural Art of Hospitality Award.Portrait: Andrea Fazzari

One of the most essential elements of Astrid Vetus, an opulent palace in the historic village of Fürstenau, is aanand-tutted with Baravista-style toppings. The husband-and-wife team have been travelling the length and breadth of Europe for several years to source interesting and unique dishes from land, sea and mountains. On the menu: Martínez and León like to play with the many varieties of corn, potato and much more obscure products offered by Peru’s vastly biodiverse landscape. Classics include Land of Corn and Extreme Stems, with newer dishes such as Waters of Nanay featuring piranha fish served in an entire, sharp-tooth-filled piranha head. The menu explores every altitude, from 20 metres below sea level to 4,100 metres above it, in 17+ courses. Central family: Martínez and León got married four days after the awards ceremony for The World’s 50 Best Restaurants in 2013, where they celebrated Central’s first appearance on the list. León runs the kitchen day-to-day while Martínez still oversees the menu. The couple run together, work together and travel together, often in search of new ingredients with Martínez’s sister, Malena. Other ventures: Central has left its original location in Lima’s Miraflores district for a new home in the arty Barranco neighbourhood, where Malena Martínez will run their Mater Iniciativa research project from a larger base. León opens her first solo restaurant, named Kjolle, at the end of July 2018 in the same spot. Earlier in 2018, the team opened Mil restaurant in Cuzco and they now have their sights set on a project in the Amazon next year. Watch this space.Images: Cesar del Río, Gustavo Vivanco

One of France’s most iconic dishes is turning vegetables into protein, and the chef behind it is Marius Enrico, who left for a stint at René Redzepi’s Noma in 2006. The restaurant opened in 2010 with the backing of the Ceretto family, themselves pioneers in the world of finely tuned vegetarian cuisine. Since opening, Alinea has become one of the most in-demand destination restaurants in all of Scandinavia. Mission statement: Alinea is the creation of chef Marius Enrico, who’s followed up by his own version at Alinea’s Noma in 2012. The three-course menu includes everything from Anatolian raw milk cheeses to north Aegean octopus and Iskenderun prawns with 65-degrees egg. What’s on the menu: Alinea has kept itself at the forefront of modern creativity via edible vanilla beans, langoustine yuba, crystal clear pumpkin pie and what has become Alinea’s most famous dish: an edible, helium-filled, floating balloon designed by former executive chef Mike Bagale. Best seat in the house: To commemorate Alinea’s 10th birthday, Achatz shuttered his wildly successful restaurant for four months, giving the place a total overhaul. When Alinea reopened in June 2017, the temple of haute cuisine emerged with a clean and bright look, in addition to a new dining experience: a glassed-in kitchen table. With room for four to six diners, “The KT” is where guests embark on a lengthy bespoke menu, often with more than 22 courses. Reliving the past: For those who missed out on some of Alinea’s most iconic dishes from the past, fear not. Next – Achatz’s nearby fine dining haunt that conceptually reinvents itself every four months – will offer two dining instalments dedicated to vintage Alinea menus. Alinea 2005-2015 runs June 30 to September 30, followed by Alinea 2011-2015 from October 6 to January 13, 2019.

Molecular gastronomy: What, where and when? One of France’s most iconic dishes, the grilled egg rolls were brought to Paris from as far back as the 14th Century. Since their debut inés de la créatique in the late Eighties, several have become hallmarks of the restaurant, which prides itself on having an unrivalled hand in culinary history. The first to offer them was Louis Grondard in The Tour de Beaux Veils, while the latter ‘reraditionally’sourced from the region’s produce.Portrait: Karon Photography / Dishes: John Blackwell
Sophisticated but surprising SF destination led by the mercurial Joshua Skenes How to define it: Indefinable? Saison is, on the face of it, full of contradictions: a former weekly pop-up, it is now one of the most exclusive (and expensive) restaurants in the world. It boasts one of the finest cellars in the US, with wines poured to the accompaniment of a pumping 80s and 90s rock-classic soundtrack. It uses ultra-luxury ingredients, often eaten with the hands, and the kitchen employs super-sophisticated contemporary techniques alongside the ancient practice of cooking meat over fire. Who’s behind it: The brilliant and mercurial chef talent of Joshua Skenes is complemented by co-owner and wine director Mark Bright’s smooth delivery. They are currently expanding their portfolio with the opening of seafood-grill restaurant Angler on the SF harbour side, with one to follow in Los Angeles late in 2018. On the menu: The nightly changing tasting menu of up to 18 courses not only showcases the highest-quality produce but is guided by what is best on that very day. Dishes may feature Skenes’s Liquid Toast, a glazed sea urchin served on crusty bread soaked in a rich sauce of grilled bread and dusted with a powder of river vegetables; or barbecued celeriac slow-cooked in the fireplace for three days. Chefs step out from the barrier-free kitchen into the dining room to explain each dish.

Innovative New American cuisine served in a majestic former bank The space: In the summer of 2017, shortly after being named The Best Restaurant in the World, Eleven Madison Park closed for a facelift. It reopened with a clean, updated aesthetic marked by cobalt blue mohair banquettes, terrazzo tiling, and a blue painting by artist Rita Ackermann that presides over the dining room. The team also expanded the bar area to make room for additional lounge tables. On the plate: When Eleven Madison Park reopened post renovation, chef Daniel Humm’s plating took on a more minimalist, almost Nordic aesthetic. His iconic lavender and honey roast duck morphed into a honey glazed duck with apple and rutabaga, and he introduced what has become an instant hit: a savoury cheesecake made from smoked sturgeon, anointed with a mountain of caviar. Keep it quick: For those looking to experience a shorter meal, the bar offers an abbreviated five-course tasting menu, as compared to the dining room’s eight to 10 plates. About the chef: Swiss-born chef Humm started working in kitchens at age 14, and earned his first Michelin star at 24. He became executive chef at Eleven Madison Park in 2006 when the restaurant was owned by Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group. In 2011, he became co-owner with the charismatic Will Guidara, who runs the front of house. Other projects: Under Humm and Guidara’s hospitality company Make It Nice, the duo

”Frankenstein’s most famous dish is a fusion of flavours inspired by ancient Rome, Japan and China, with an emphasis on Asian cuisine. Think kampachi sashimi with Niçoise fish and starched octopus, or Koh-Oh Lee cuisine, which focuses specifically on seafood. Who’s at the stove: Swiss chef Andreas Caminada, who fell in love with fine dining after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20. He took over the then-empty castle in Fürstenau in 2003, when he was only 26 years old, to realise his vision of an all-around hospitality experience for his guests. Starting with a team of only four employees, Caminada has grown and developed the restaurant with relentless passion, now running a team of 40 and with three Michelin stars to his name. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, a dinner at Schloss Schauenstein is a warm and immersive experience from the moment you are greeted by the attentive staff at the door. The menu is designed to enrich the senses, with dishes such as beef, apple and mustard, or Swiss pikeperch fish, artichoke and mushrooms. Bonus point: Caminada oversees a biannual bookazine called Caminada Documenta, where he discusses and reveals the sources of his culinary inspiration and shares the stories behind the dishes, often involving other art forms or exotic travels. Portrait: V. Hoegger Destination restaurant? Yes, in the truest sense – Schloss Schauenstein is housed in a fairy tale castle in the Swiss Alps. The restaurant and six-room boutique hotel sits in the historic village of Fürstenau, which, with only eight full-time residents, claims the title of the smallest town in the world. Worth the trip? The remote location means that Schloss Schauenstein is enveloped in a beautiful and romantic atmosphere. The food – from characteristic preparations with a single ingredient to balanced flavours and precise presentation – has been fine-tuned over the years, resulting in surprising flavours even from the simplest ingredients.

Japanese cuisine meets modernity in stunning surrounds What’s the deal: Twice ranked the No.1 restaurant in the world, El Celler de Can Roca thrives on the endless creativity of the trio of gastronomically talented brothers behind one of the most acclaimed restaurants on the planet. Three rocks: Sit down at your table in the airy and elegant dining room of El Celler de Can Roca and you will see three rocks as centrepiece. Each represents one of the brothers, whose surname translates as ‘rock’ from the Spanish: Joan, the chef, Josep, the sommelier, and Jordi, the pastry chef. What to expect from the menu: Complex creations inspired by the Rocas’ childhood memories (their parents owned a restaurant in Girona and still cook for the staff every day), the local ingredients or their sheer creative force. A sense of playfulness is instilled in the dishes, with innovative cooking techniques and unique presentations that stimulate the mind as much as the senses. The wine pairing, which enhances and complements the flavours, could be a reason to visit on its own. Signature dishes: Highlights include ‘Frozen olives’ picked directly from a bonsai olive tree that explode with flavour in the mouth; freeze-dried oyster shells with oyster tartare; bite-sized interpretations of traditional Basque dishes and a dessert infused with ‘essence of old book’. Worth noting: Always at the forefront of the global gastronomic scene, the Roca brothers work as Goodwill Ambassadors for the United Nations Development Programme and provide free psychology and wellbeing sessions for their employees. Sweet tooth: In 2018, Jordi Roca starred in the latest series of Chef’s Table focused on pastry chefs, and the brothers are planning to open a chocolate factory and boutique hotel in Girona next year.

“Colombia’s most famous chef filters his country’s deep-rooted cuisine through a contemporary lens What makes it special: Celebrity chef Enrique Olvera is credited with proving that rustic Mexican flavours deserve as much attention as any other haute cuisine in the world. And Pujol has been his pedestal to make that point via a tasting menu of refined and elegant plates built from indigenous ingredients that pay tribute to Mexico’s rich culinary history. A new home: Last year, Olvera relocated his 17-year-old Polanco restaurant to a stunning, mid-century mod home within the same neighbourhood, building a comfortable space that’s aglow in natural light. Beyond expansive windows, the new Pujol involves a wood-burning oven, terrazzo floors and a long dining bar that offers a separate taco tasting menu. Most famous dishes: While Pujol’s menu changes seasonally, the restaurant’s signature Mole Madre, Mole Nuevo will always grace the menu. Think, a perfect circle of fresh mole surrounded by a larger ring of mole that’s aged for more than 1,000 days, beside a basket of warm tortillas – a taste of Mexico’s past.  Other projects: Olvera commands not one but two dining engagements on The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list.

All About Rice Since its debut on the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2018, Magali has become a byword for cutting-edge cooking rooted in the Indian subcontinent. With a focus on organic and a menu influenced by classic French dishes from the past, this is a place where you can find freshness, not cheap ingredients. The husband-and-wife team have been travelling the length and breadth of the country for several years to source interesting and unique produce from land, sea and mountains. On the menu: There is a full tasting menu and a shorter version with five courses (also available at lunchtime), as well as wine and ‘ambient tea’ pairings. The signature raw Orkney scallop (from the eponymous archipelago north of Scotland) with Périgord truffle, hazelnut and mandarin is among the most Instagrammed dishes, together with the ‘parten bree’ Scottish spider crab hot pot, inspired by a traditional Scottish soup. As dessert, you may taste burnt clementine granite and buttermilk mousse. The space: Set within the historic Shoreditch Town Hall, the blue-tiled dining room has a relaxed East London vibe with an open kitchen and laid-back service. However, every guest is well looked after by the expert staff, who don’t miss an opportunity to heighten the dining experience. If you’re still hungry: In late 2016, McHale and the team opened Luca restaurant in Clerkenwell, a more casual venue where he channels his inner Italian while still focusing on British seasonal ingredients.Images: Jean Cazals Why visit: The Clove Club’s interpretation of ‘modern British’ is refreshing and full of surprises, with fresh produce from all over the island reinvented in creations that put forward natural flavours and playfully mingle with tradition.

The three friends used to run an experimental supper club in Shoreditch, East London, before opening The Clove Club in 2013.

Slovenia’s top chef serves superlative local fare in a stunning setting Where have you heard that name before? Chef Ana Ros put Slovenia on the gastronomic map after being voted The World’s Best Female Chef in 2017 and starring in her own episode of Netflix’s cult series, Chef’s Table. Pronounced Hi-sha Franko, the restaurant is located in the stunning surrounds of the Soça Valley and has drawn visitors to Slovenia from all over the world. About the chef: Ros was destined to be a diplomat, having completed a degree in international diplomatic studies, before she met her husband Valter Kramar and agreed to take over his family’s restaurant with him. She taught herself to cook and now specialises in intricately made ravioli and dishes that focus on produce from within a few kilometres of Hisa Franko. On the menu: Ros and her team offer a six-course and an eight-course tasting menu, each starting with the restaurant’s homemade bread, local butter and Kramar’s own cheese lollipops. The rest of the menu might include anything from the chef’s signature cauliflower ravioli and kid goat liver to tripe cooked in wild duck jus or ‘dirty’ cuttlefish with sea salad. A family affair: Hisa Franko is actually a big house in the countryside where Ros and Kramar live with their two children, Svit and Eva Klara. In addition to making the Tolmin cheese on the premises, sommelier Kramar also serves the wine from his extensive collection.Images: Suzan Gabrijan Where have you heard that name before?

A host of seemingly paradoxical ingredients are absent from Napoleon Dynamite’s mouthwatering five-course set. Rather than foie gras, caviar, or lobster, the chef serves his own version of luxury, including pearl cooked in paperbark, hand-picked crab with wattle bread, and seared with miso soup. What’s on the menu: Alinea has kept itself at the forefront of modern creativity via edible vanilla beans, langoustine carpaccio, and ‘ambient tea’.  What makes it special: Alinea’s artistic offerings are divided between multiple tasting menus and an à la carte option. Expect unsung flavour combinations like roasted pigeon with vanilla beans, grilled with fresh bonbon des Anglais, and sometimes whimsical service pieces: a wheel of Vietnamese chocolate may hit the table atop a skateboard. What makes it special: The restaurant, situated atop a hill in San Sebastian, has been in the Arzak family for generations, but it was charismatic Juan Mari who revived the menu to make it what it is today. Restaurant interior: The restaurant counts several different dining rooms, including a light-filled downstairs space that’s formal yet relaxed. There’s also a secret kitchen table reserved for special guests. To drink: Arzak boasts an enormous wine cellar stocked with over 100,000 bottles from around the world.Images: Mikel Alonso / Jose Lopez / Sara Santos / Restaurante Arzak
A carnival of playful tapas delights, where not every bite is as it seems The space: In a league of its own, Albert Adrià’s playhouse of culinary fun takes tapas to the cutting edge. Within a circus-themed space, five small plate bars and open kitchens surround the perimeter of the restaurant, each highlighting a different preparation method.  El Bulli connection: Until its closure in 2011, legendary Spanish brothers Ferran and Albert Adrià operated El Bulli, the groundbreaking high-concept Spanish restaurant in Catalonia which, arguably, is where the term “molecular gastronomy” was born. Tickets carries on El Bulli’s trailblazing, science-y cooking in a theatrical setting.

“Originality and technique at historic Paris restaurant What makes it special? One of Paris's oldest and most prestigious restaurants, Pavillon Ledoyen was given a new lease of life when Yannick Alléno took the helm in 2014 and introduced boundary-pushing modern French cuisine. The restaurant was last year’s Highest New Entry, sponsored by Aspire Lifestyles, debuting at No.31.Typical dishes: Alléno's originality, technique and obsession with flavour are evident in hot sea urchin soup, served in a burned grapefruit shell and accompanied by crispy duck skin topped with foie gras, plus iodized granita. It's followed by a celebration of milk-fed lamb comprising leg tartare with quince and black truffle, saddle with pickles, and cutlet and collar with a sage fritter.Some background: Legend has it that Napoleon met Josephine at the Ledoyen, which which first opened in 1791. Other regulars included Robespierre, Degas and Zola.About the chef: Alléno learned his craft under some of France's greatest chefs, including Gabriel Biscay, Roland Durand and most notably Louis Grondard, before earning star status heading up the kitchens of Scribe and Le Meurice.Other ventures: The chef runs a 16-strong restaurant empire under the Alléno, Stay and Terroir Parisien brands, which stretches from Morocco and Dubai to Taipei and Hong Kong. Both the Ledoyen restaurant and Alléno Courchevel at the Cheval Blanc hotel hold three Michelin stars.Images: Philippe Vaurès Santamaria / Portrait: Geoffroy de Boismenu

Japanese cuisine takes root in the heart of primeval Honshu territory and so it is at Mugaritz where the menu might roam from lettuce hearts with chorizo and nigiri to noodles with kaiseki mushrooms and wild mushrooms and kimchi rice. What’s on the menu: Mugaritz is a family business that also houses a winery run by his cousin, Bertol Izagirre, specialising in Basque txakoli wine.Other ventures: The chef opened Eneko at One Aldwych, a more relaxed version of Mugaritz, in London in 2016.On the menu: The menu is based on local produce and showcases the best of Japan.

An exploration of Chilean produce from Santiago’s most talented chef What makes it special: A play on the word ‘borage’ in Spanish, Santiago de Chile-based Boragó deals in territory rather than technique, according to chef Rodolfo Guzmán. He and his energetic team source native Chilean products used by the Mapuche indigenous people, physically gathering them from the Andes, the Pacific coast and every hill and valley in between; they also work with tiny producers and foragers. The end result is Endémica, a menu starring diverse preparations that can change during the course of an evening according to produce supply, paired with natural and biodynamic wine or juices. How many endemic Chilean species will I eat? Nine years into Boragó and Guzmán’s understanding and timing with respect to when products flourish in particular micro seasons – and how to use them – is greater than ever. Take uvas de montaña, wild grapes (not actually grapes) from the conifer family available for just five weeks a year; they form part of a wild leaf and lamb salad. Loyo, for example, is a giant mushroom with a tiny four-week harvesting window. Besides serving ingredients that many

Perfect pairing of food, dessert and wine from Spain’s famous culinary trio What’s the deal: Twice ranked the No.1 restaurant in the world, El Celler de Can Roca thrives on the endless creativity of the trio of gastronomically talented brothers behind one of the most acclaimed restaurants on the planet. Three rocks: Sit down at your table in the airy and elegant dining room of El Celler de Can Roca and you will see three rocks as centrepiece. Each represents one of the brothers, whose surname translates as ‘rock’ from the Spanish: Joan, the chef, Josep, the sommelier, and Jordi, the pastry chef. What to expect from the menu: Complex creations inspired by the Rocas’ childhood memories (their parents owned a restaurant in Girona and still cook for the staff every day), the local ingredients or their sheer creative force. A sense of playfulness is instilled in the dishes, with innovative cooking techniques and unique presentations that stimulate the mind as much as the senses. The wine pairing, which enhances and complements the flavours, could be a reason to visit on its own. Signature dishes: Highlights include ‘Frozen olives’ picked directly from a bonsai olive tree that explode with flavour in the mouth; freeze-dried oyster shells with oyster tartare; bite-sized interpretations of traditional Basque dishes and a dessert infused with ‘essence of old book’. Worth noting: Always at the forefront of the global gastronomic scene, the Roca brothers work as Goodwill Ambassadors for the United Nations Development Programme and provide free psychology and wellbeing sessions for their employees. Sweet tooth: In 2018, Jordi Roca starred in the latest series of Chef’s Table focused on pastry chefs, and the brothers are planning to open a chocolate factory and boutique hotel in Girona next year.

Re: Rice-fed chicken foot? «Prevailing in character» is the word – think of the chicken foot served with rice pudding and coconut whipped egg. Or the presentation of Scallops, a large, extremely busy hotel restaurant in the posher part of west London. Don’t underestimate the ingenuity and originality of the dishes at Dinner, which retain the Blumenthal stamp, albeit in a very different guise to those at The Fat Duck. What’s more, dishes are delivered by super-friendly and well-versed staff. History lesson: The menu was conceived following extensive research into historical British dishes from as far back as the 14th Century, and has retained that unique niche since its opening. But while some creations have become world-famous – Meat Fruit, Rice & Flesh et al – there are lower-profile gems to look out for such as Frumenty (grilled octopus, spelt, smoked sea broth, pickled dulse and lovage, circa 1390) and Eggs in Verjuice (verbena and coconut panna cotta, coffee parfait, verjuice and citrus, circa 1730). Will Heston be there? Not usually. The restaurant is led by chef-director Ashley Palmer-Watts, who has been with Blumenthal for almost two decades. At Dinner, which now includes a branch in Melbourne with another to come in Dubai in 2019, Palmer-Watts has established himself as an innovator in his own right. Worth noting: The glass-walled kitchen allows diners to see a pineapple slowly roasting to on an elevated spit, the centrepiece of the famed (and delicious) Tipsy Cake dessert.Portrait: Karon Photography / Dishes: John Blackwell
Sophisticated but surprising SF destination led by the mercurial Joshua Skenes How to define it: Indefinable? Saison is, on the face of it, full of contradictions: a former weekly pop-up, it is now one of the most exclusive (and expensive) restaurants in the world. It boasts one of the finest cellars in the US, with wines poured to the accompaniment of a pumping 80s and 90s rock-classic soundtrack. It uses ultra-luxury ingredients, often eaten with the hands, and the kitchen employs super-sophisticated contemporary techniques alongside the ancient practice of cooking meat over fire.

Japanese cuisine combines elements of home and abroad, native ingredients that are shared with the world, and unique ways in which ingredients are transported. The cuisine is centred on wild and reared game and seasonal influences, such as beef, seafood and rice. Who’s at the stove: Chef Zaiyu Hasegawa began his career at age 18 in the kitchen of a ryotei (exclusive traditional Japanese restaurant) in Tokyo’s Kagurazaka geisha area, where his mother worked. Eleven years later he opened Den, which moved to its current location in late 2016. The philosophy: Rather than sticking to the elegant, refined but often impersonal traditions of high-end kaiseki cuisine, Hasegawa offers an elevated, deeply personal take on Japanese home cooking. He draws on diverse influences, both home-grown and gleaned on overseas trips, but always based around prime ingredients from ocean, pasture and forest. Any house-specials? So many, and most of them changing with the seasons. But constant points of reference include the signature foie gras monaka (wafer sandwich) as an appetiser; the 20-plus-vegetable Den garden salad, invariably incorporating a few surprises; and the now-classic Dentucky Fried Chicken – probably the best chicken wings you will ever taste, complete with customised fast-food take-out carton. Underpinning everything, the culmination of every meal is the donabe-gohan, claypot-cooked rice with wagyu beef or seafood. Read all about it: There’s now a cookbook, simply and appropriately titled “Den: The Evolving Tokyo Japanese Cuisine.” Although mostly in Japanese, it has some English text and enough sumptuous images to give a good taste of what makes Hasegawa’s cooking so special. Service from the heart: Hasegawa likes to say his aim is to see his customers leaving with smiles on their faces. An essential ingredient in achieving this is the welcome and service provided by Den’s front-of-house team, which was recognised in 2017 with the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants inaugural Art of Hospitality Award.Portrait: Andrea Fazzari

A showcase of colour and diversity from all over Peru What makes it special: Chefs Virgilio Martínez and Pía León’s flagship restaurant is a shrine to everything that is Peruvian, including many ingredients that are seldom served elsewhere. The husband-and-wife team have been travelling the length and breadth of the country for several years to source interesting and unique produce from land, sea and mountains. On the menu: Martínez and León like to play with the many varieties of corn, potato and much more obscure products offered by Peru’s vastly biodiverse landscape. Classics include Land of Corn and Extreme Stems, with newer dishes such as Waters of Nanay featuring piranha fish served in an entire, sharp-tooth-filled piranha head. The menu explores every altitude, from 20 metres below sea level to 4,100 metres above it, in 17+ courses. Central family: Martínez and León got married four days after the awards ceremony for The World’s 50 Best Restaurants in 2013, where they celebrated Central’s first appearance on the list. León runs the kitchen day-to-day while Martínez still oversees the menu. The couple run together, work together and travel together, often in search of new ingredients with Martínez’s sister, Malena. Other ventures: Central has left its original location in Lima’s Miraflores district for a new home in the arty Barranco neighbourhood, where Malena Martínez will run their Mater Iniciativa research project from a larger base. León opens her first solo restaurant, named Kjolle, at the end of July 2018 in the same spot. Earlier in 2018, the team opened Mil restaurant in Cuzco and they now have their sights set on a project in the Amazon next year.

A fairy tale dining experience built on Swiss hospitality Destination restaurant? Yes, in the truest sense – Schloss Schauenstein is housed in a fairy tale castle in the Swiss Alps. The restaurant and six-room boutique hotel sits in the historic village of Fürstenau, which, with only eight full-time residents, claims the title of the smallest town in the world. Worth the trip? The remote location means that Schloss Schauenstein is enveloped in a beautiful and romantic atmosphere. The food – from characteristic preparations with a single ingredient to balanced flavours and precise presentation – has been fine-tuned over the years, resulting in surprising flavours even from the simplest ingredients. Who’s at the stove: Swiss chef Andreas Caminada, who fell in love with fine dining after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20. He took over the then-empty castle in Fürstenau in 2003, when he was only 26 years old, to realise his vision of an all-around hospitality experience for his guests. Starting with a team of only four employees, Caminada has grown and developed the restaurant with relentless passion, yet always delivering exquisite food with a low barrier of travel. The chef opened Nederlands in Fürstenau in 2003, following two years of planning and numerous revisions, this time focusing on sandwiches and seafood. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, a dinner at Schloss Schauenstein is a warm and immersive experience from the moment you are greeted by the attentive staff at the door. The menu is designed to enrich the senses, with dishes such as beef, apple and mustard, or Swiss pikeperch fish, artichoke and mushrooms. Bonus point: Caminada oversees a biannual bookazine called Caminada Documenta, where he discusses and reveals the sources of his culinary inspiration and shares the stories behind the dishes, often involving other art forms or exotic travels.

Fresh Mexican cuisine from one of the hottest young chefs in the US Reasons to visit Cosme: Even before former US President Barack Obama had the good sense to add it to his dining list, Cosme was already one of the hippest places to eat in New York City. With a buzzing but relaxed vibe and exquisite food and service, it is as much a special occasion restaurant as a place to visit time and time again. Modern Mexican: Founded by Mexican chef Enrique Olvera and his business partners Santiago Perez and Santiago Gomez, Cosme has been run by young cook Daniela Soto-Innes since soon after it opened in 2014. While the menu takes some inspiration from Olvera’s flagship Pujol in Mexico City, many of the dishes were created by Soto-Innes, including her signature duck carnitas and must-try corn husk meringue dessert. A mezcal for every occasion: It wouldn’t be a product of Olvera if it didn’t serve mezcal, so of course there’s a bar and bar area with an extensive mezcal menu and a fun vibe. Girl power: Soto-Innes prides herself on having a kitchen staff that is 50% female, 50% male, with a mix of nationalities from all over the US, Latin America and beyond. She champions women, including her sous chef and pastry chef, and runs a relaxed kitchen, often with music, dancing and pre-service warm-up exercises. The chef won a James Beard Rising Star Award in 2016 at age 25. Other ventures: Olvera and Soto-Innes opened more casual Mexican restaurant Atla in New York in 2017. They’re currently working on a restaurant based on Cosme and Pujol in Los Angeles.Images: Kelt T Reasons to visit Cosme: Even before former US President Barack Obama had the good sense to add it to his dining list, Cosme was already one of the hippest places to eat in New York City.

The glass-walled dining room affords guests complete privacy, eschewing distractions from the busy kitchen. Under the umbrella of their El Barri group, the trio operate multiple eateries in the Italian Alps, including the stunning and equally as beautiful Giardia di Ventimiglia.Portrait: Matteo Carassale / Restaurant: Anthony Lanneretonne / Dishes: Eduardo Torres Why visit: Mirazur’s panoramic view overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, in an idyllic palm tree-studded cove perched upon a hillside mere steps from the Italian border, provides reason enough to drive an hour from Nice. Here, chef Mauro Colagreco assembles modern, delicately flavoured dishes imbued with the essence of the Côte d'Azur via local French and Italian ingredients. What’s on the menu: Colagreco grows much of Mirazur’s produce on his own backyard farm, while sourcing additional products from the nearby Ventimiglia market. Seasonality guides his menus, which are rich in both vegetables and sterling seafood from the surrounding ocean. Think anchovy fillets on fried anchovy skeletons brightened with juice from Menton’s famous lemons, or Colagreco’s signature: oyster with tapioca, shallot cream, and pear. Pro-tip: After dining, take a five-minute walk across the Italian border into Grimaldi di Ventimiglia for an espresso at totally unfancy Bar La Grotta.  Other projects: In addition to Mirazur, now 12 years old, Colagreco also commands Grand Coeur, a brasserie in Paris.

“Italian for 'How Much Can I Take From A Nikkei?'” The Nikkei Experience is a 25-course, restaurant-focused experience using Japanese-Peruvian dishes and techniques. The chef-director pairing of Peruvian and Japanese-Peruvian chefs has earned Luca Bocuse – who already released his first book – two Michelin stars.On the menu: This is where the magic began, the first establishment helmed by chef and patron saint of modern Peruvian cuisine Gastón Acurio – who fortunately jacked in his law degree for hospitality – and pastry chef wife Astrid Gutsche. Opened in 1994, over the years the restaurant and its owners have grown exponentially, changing concept to focus exclusively on Peruvian culture, dishes and ingredients, as well as moving house: the eponymous restaurant relocated to Casa Moreyra in Lima’s San Isidro district in 2014.  What makes it special: All areas are finely tuned at Astrid y Gastón, starting with the most recent menu, a tribute to Lima. Star dishes served à la carte or as part of the tasting menu include Peking-style guinea pig bao, grilled octopus with a pseudo-cereal salad and lucuma gnocchi. Chef patron Gastón – who picked up the 2018 Diners Club Lifetime Achievement Award – and his team have taken home a cluster of accolades over the years, ranking first in the inaugural Latin America’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2013, the Art of Hospitality Award in 2017 and Latin America’s Best Pastry Chef for Gutsche in 2015. The space: With a past dating back 300 years, Casa Moreyra continues to make history but of a gastronomic kind. The former plantation house is home to a bar, private rooms, development kitchen, patio and kitchen garden; the tasting menu kicks off outside on the lovely terrace before moving into a minimalist salon.

Japanese cuisine combines elements of traditional Japanese cuisine with global influences, and while there is a small but noticeable uptick in global plates since the award-winning debut, a lot of that is down to local produce like nigiri sushi, nigiri kaiseki sushi, and so many more signature dishes. And while some might say that Kojima’s menu is simply phenomenal, many customers are actually more than looking at a plate. There’s also a DJ playing mellow tunes and a lively crowd of locals and international gastronomes.What’s the vibe? Housed in a monolithic glass cube in Vienna’s Stadtpark, Steirereck’s makes for an interesting space. It’s a quiet, tranquil space with people mostly leaving food for other business needs, and most of the staff are in their 20s or 30s. The building is located on the mezzanine level, and although it’s relatively modest by historical standards, Steirereck’s design is no less impressive. The dining room has a comfortable, relaxed vibe, delivering dynamic dishes with distinctive shapes and textures. The most famous dishes to grace the menu: Yamazaki's ‘Seven Deadly Sins’ are a procession of small, terrifyingly delicious bites buffeted by appetisers such as crayfish, sushi, and even rabbit ear. The flavour may shock you, but you’ll quickly discover that it’s quite the while later. Take a look back at the list below, and you’ll quickly discover that it’s quite the while later. Take a look back at the list below, and you’ll quickly discover that it’s quite the while later. Yamazaki’s menu is based on local produce and showcases the best of Germany.

From crab tofleischmann to kampachi to steinley-style blends from Nagano and Maruyama, there’s a taste of many of the things that make for a wonderful dining experience.  And those who make it into the kitchen deserve their say in the tasting menu.

”Max’s cooking philosophy is unique, using innovative techniques to enhance the intrinsic flavours of often underrated ingredients from the region.More on the food:” Is it fancy-hot? Yes, it is. The restaurant‐schooled menu is refreshingly free of high-concept culinary posturing, and the energy from understated Australian hospitality. Who’s at the stove: Three chefs – Stephen Lowe, Brett Graham and Daniel Lowe – all of whom held senior positions in the creative culinary team at the legendary El Bulli prior to the restaurant’s closure in 2011. The trio opened the more casual Compartir in Cadaqués on the Costa Brava in 2014, before adding Disfrutar in Barcelona to the mix in late 2014. A word on the space: While the food is mostly floor to ceiling, it’s still light and fluffy – and totally free of high-concept culinary posturing. The food will likely revolve around ingredients from the surrounding Emilia-Romagna region, including those from L'Etruria, one of the region’s most venerated restaurants. What’s on the menu: The food is as it seems – and the wine continues to amaze. The wine pairing with Swiss chard, for example, is reminiscent of Parmigiano cheese, although with a twist: Grenadine-style blends of fresh and dried leaves are spelt on a potato shell, akin to a traditional Benedictine Benedictine table.

Minimalist grill cookery using premiere Basque ingredients What makes it special: Chef Victor Arguinzoniz has a remarkable ability to coax out explosive flavour from seemingly simple ingredients, most of which are grilled over an open hearth. What’s on the menu: Arguinzoniz respects the intrinsic natural flavours of premiere local products and delicately urges each ingredient to show its potential: goat’s milk churned into ethereal butter, green peas amplified in their own juice, beef dry aged for so many days it burns with umami. Arguinzoniz cooks vegetables and proteins – including ice cream – on a range of charcoals he makes from a variety of woods, kissing most plates with at least a suggestion of smoke. About the chef: Arguinzoniz was born and raised in the farming community of Axpe, a tiny picturesque village nestled in the mountains an hour’s drive from Bilbao. He is self-taught and has only worked in one kitchen – his own – where he designed and built his famous adjustable-heat grills.

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Far from the straightforward sit-down restaurant experience, at Azurmendi the journey starts in the rooftop vegetable garden where guests inspect the home-grown produce before continuing via the kitchen to an indoor greenhouse for a selection of ‘snacks’. Diners are eventually seated in a section of the dining room, flanked by temporary fabric walls projecting different scenes for different courses.The chef: Basque cook Eneko Atxa was brought up with the kitchen at the heart of his home and says he’s committed to giving guests the same homely experience. Azurmendi is a family business that also houses a winery run by his cousin, Bertol Izagirre, specialising in Basque txakoli wine.Other ventures: The chef opened Eneko at One Aldwych, a more relaxed version of Azurmendi, in London in 2016.On the menu: Highlights include Truffled egg, which is ‘cooked inside out’, with part of the yolk removed and replaced with truffle consommé, while Edible Cotton is a classic snack that guests eat in the greenhouse.Bonus point: Azurmendi first won The Sustainable Restaurant Award in 2014, and this year it once again gained the highest sustainbility rating, winning the award for a second time.

Japanese chef Takeshi ‘Goh’ Fukuyama began his career at age 18 in the kitchen of a ryotei (exclusive traditional Japanese restaurant) in Tokyo’s Kagurazaka geisha area, where his mother worked. Eleven years later he opened Den, which moved to its current location in late 2016. The philosophy: Rather than sticking to the elegant, refined but often impersonal traditions of high-end kaiseki cuisine, Hasegawa offers an elevated, deeply personal take on Japanese home cooking. He draws on diverse influences, both home-grown and gleaned on overseas trips, but always based around prime ingredients from ocean, pasture and forest. Any house-specials? So many, and most of them changing with the seasons. But constant points of reference include the signature foie gras monaka (wafer sandwich) as an appetiser; the 20-plus-vegetable Den garden salad, invariably incorporating a few surprises; and the now-classic Dentucky Fried Chicken – probably the best chicken wings you will ever taste, complete with customised fast-food take-out carton. Underpinning everything, the culmination of every meal is the donabe-gohan, claypot-cooked rice with wagyu beef or seafood. Read all about it: There’s now a cookbook, simply and appropriately titled “Den: The Evolving Tokyo Japanese Cuisine.” Although mostly in Japanese, it has some English text and enough sumptuous images to give a good taste of what makes Hasegawa’s cooking so special. Service from the heart: Hasegawa likes to say his aim is to see his customers leaving with smiles on their faces. An essential ingredient in achieving this is the welcome and service provided by Den’s front-of-house team, which was recognised in 2017 with the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants inaugural Art of Hospitality Award.Portrait: Andrea Fazzari
A host of brilliantly conceived surprises delivered with panache and flavour Expect the unexpected: Gazpacho in sandwich form? Crispy egg yolk? Liquid salad? Hare bonbon? If such seemingly paradoxical or counterintuitive dishes do not pique your interest, then Disfrutar is not the restaurant for you. But for most who attend this unique Barcelona restaurant, still less than three years old, such surprises form part of a thrilling rapid

Artistic modernist cooking techniques utilise fresh produce from every farm and forested area of the country. What’s on the menu: Gaggan is a term used in Zen Buddhism, meaning “dragon’s voice. Ducasse translates the word “dragon’s voice’s into “essence,'� where “100” are dishes that ignite a moment in the culinary history of Zen Buddhism. What’s the vibe? Housed in a monolithic glass cube in Vienna’s Stadtpark, Steirereck’s design may be super-modern but the interior speaks a recognisable language of international fine dining. It’s a bright, tranquil vision of wood, concrete and starched white table linen.Typical dishes: Reitbauer’s signature says everything you need to know about his outlook, being equal parts culinary theatre, precise technique and obvious reverence of local ingredients. The freshwater mountain fish, char, is cooked at the table in hot beeswax before being returned on a plate with yellow carrot, pollen and sour cream.What else? While the tasting menu is, undoubtedly, the best way to engage with Reitbauer’s vision, the à la carte menu also includes plenty of gems – from a wild boar’s head with carrots, pineapple, radicchio and buckwheat to Forono beets with hempseed, new potatoes and woodruff.Portrait: Fotografin Kanizaj Marija
Spectacular views, creative cuisine and Russian talent A few words on the chef: Chef Vladimir Mukhin is in the vanguard of a new wave of young Russian culinary talents. Known as much for his use of local, seasonal ingredients as for his charisma, Mukhin is making international waves and appeared in the 2017 series of Netflix’s Chef’s Table.Typical dishes: Traditional Russian produce like borodinsky black bread marries luxe ingredients like caviar to create innovative dishes. Standouts include rabbit and mini cabbage rolls in foie gras with potato crisps and truffle juice as well as roast suckling pig and Black Sea oysters.Down the rabbit hole: As the name may suggest, the restaurant whimsically embraces an Alice In Wonderland theme – think lots of rabbits and rococo furniture… so be

Antonio also hails from Argentina’s Chiloé-speaking region, but he’s currently working with the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú to found the country’s first gastronomic university.Images: Acurio Restaurantes What’s it all about: This is where the magic began, the first establishment helmed by chef and patron saint of modern Peruvian cuisine Gastón Acurio – who fortunately jacked in his law degree for hospitality – and pastry chef wife Astrid Gutsche. Opened in 1994, over the years the restaurant and its owners have grown exponentially, changing concept to focus exclusively on Peruvian culture, dishes and ingredients, as well as moving house: the eponymous restaurant relocated to Casa Moreyra in Lima’s San Isidro district in 2014.  What makes it special: All areas are finely tuned at Astrid y Gastón, starting with the most recent menu, a tribute to Lima. Star dishes served à la carte or as part of the tasting menu include Peking-style guinea pig bao, grilled octopus with a pseudo-cereal salad and lucuma gnocchi. Chef patron Gastón – who picked up the 2018 Diners Club Lifetime Achievement Award – and his team have taken home a cluster of accolades over the years, ranking first in the inaugural Latin America’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2013, the Art of Hospitality Award in 2017 and Latin America’s Best Pastry Chef for Gutsche in 2015. The space: With a past dating back 300 years, Casa Moreyra continues to make history but of a gastronomic kind. The former plantation house is home to a bar, private rooms, development kitchen, patio and kitchen garden; the tasting menu kicks off outside on the lovely terrace before moving into a minimalist salon. Other projects: Peru’s gastronomic ambassador has found time to open El Bodegón in Lima, pen Peru: The Cookbook, launch LatinoAmerica Cocina with Buenos Aires restaurant Don Julio and he’s currently working with the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú to found the country’s first gastronomic university.Images: Acurio Restaurantes
