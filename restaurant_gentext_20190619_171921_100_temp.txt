“Though originally conceived as a lab experiment, Hasegawa has quickly come to be recognised as one of the most visionary leaders in experimentalist cooking in modern times. Having apprenticed under Josep Vallejo at the Plaza hotel, Hasegawa opened The Rodal restaurant in 1999, turning vegetables into wine and becoming adept at integrating them with dishes. His first outing as co-owner was the now-famous saffron, which was later substituted for fish in The World’s 50 Best Restaurants.Typical dishes: Traditional Russian produce like borodinsky black bread marries luxe ingredients like caviar to create innovative dishes. Standouts include rabbit and truffle muffin wrapped with caviar, and truffle liver cooked in caviar clay – a common snack for the Russian kitchen.Down the rabbit hole: As the name may suggest, the restaurant whimsically embraces an Alice In Wonderland theme – think lots of rabbits and rococo furniture… so be sure not to be late for your very important dinner date.Served with a side of scenic: The restaurant’s glass dome provides diners with a spectacular 360-degree view of the beautiful city of Moscow.
Inventive, artistic Italian dishes matched with superb wines in truffle country What to expect: A taste of Piemonte, one of the finest food and wine regions of the world, through the sharply focused culinary lens of Enrico Crippa, now firmly established as among Italy’s most creative chefs. Diners can select from the à la carte options, or choose from three tasting menus, one of which focuses specifically on the local Langhe region, while the others are more wide-ranging (while still distinctively Italian). During white truffle season, tables are at even more of a premium than usual. More about the chef: Crippa opened Piazza Duomo in 2005 with the backing of the Ceretto family, themselves pioneers in the region’s winemaking resurgence of recent decades. A quiet and supremely dedicated professional, he trained and worked extensively in Europe and Japan and was mentored by the late great Italian chef Gaultiero Marchesi. Highlights: The restaurant’s most famous dish is the Salad 21, 31, 41, 51, which incorporates a cornucopia of leaves, herbs and vegetables, the precise number and make-up of which changes according

Abstract: This is the second book by José Andrés, the personification of a time when products were made in a single mountain town. Led by chef and patron saint of modern Peruvian cuisine Gastón Acurio – who fortunately jacked in his law degree for hospitality – questions any daily routine are guests greeted by “Peruvian cuisine in action.” Dishes are made from a richlycollected soya powder and clay and there’s also a Bakelite grill cookery set to music.What’s the vibe? Housed in a monolithic glass cube in Lima’s San Isidro district are Segundo Cáceres, sumptuous little surprises that animate with reason.

Use a picnic table from the showy wooden benches, which are made from Conectáz (cereal) or lezón (concerted music, whimsical dishes). Who’s at the stove: Spanish chef and patron saint of modern Peruvian cuisine Gastón Acurio is at the helm of a dining room full of mesmerising artefacts – including artefacts that look like artefacts from the Aztecs. What’s on the menu: Acurio and his team offer a six-course and an eight-course tasting menu, each starting with the restaurant’s homemade bread, local produce or the local wine. The rest of the menu might include anything from the chef’s signature cauliflower ravioli and kid goat liver to tripe cooked in wild duck jus or ‘dirty’ cuttlefish with sea salad. A family affair: Hisa Franko is actually a big house in the countryside where Ros and Ros Aventador live; work in the industry, what’s at the heart of Ros’s cooking is her passion for cooking. She taught herself to cook and now she’s fully committed to the restaurant. She left home at 19 and spent eight years cooking for lower-profile chefs, including one embarking on a four-course menu that included a tartané duck with sea salad and a marron with quinces and black truffle. In time, he left for a stint at René Redzepi’s Noma and opened La Napoule in Cuzco and Anthonyet’s Mateu restaurant in Cuzco and Piazza Duomo in Cuzco and Santiago de Chile in 2014.  What makes it special: All areas are finely tuned at La Napoule, starting with the most recent menu, a tribute to Lima. Star dishes served à la carte or as part of the tasting menu include Peking-style guinea pig bao, grilled octopus with a pseudo-cereal salad and lucuma gnocchi. Chef patron Gastón – who picked up the 2018 Diners Club Lifetime Achievement Award – and his team have taken home a cluster of accolades over the years, ranking first in the inaugural Latin America’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2013, the Art of Hospitality Award in 2017 and Latin America’s Best Pastry Chef for Gutsche in 2015.

Notes from July 2018 in our list of Must-see sights and sounds. Highlights include Piazza Duomo’s finest staff moment, the moment’s-­momentous birthyear of Argentine chef Arguin Gomez, and the restaurant’s most famous dish: an edible, helium-filled, floating balloon designed by former executive chef Mike Bercovici. What to expect: It may be a large, extremely busy hotel restaurant in the posher part of west London, but don’t underestimate the ingenuity and originality of the dishes at Dinner, which retain the Blumenthal stamp, albeit in a very different guise to those at The Fat Duck. What’s more, dishes are delivered by super-friendly and well-versed staff. History lesson: The menu was conceived following extensive research into historical British dishes from as far back as the 14th Century, and has retained that unique niche since its opening. But while some creations have become world-famous – Meat Fruit, Rice & Flesh et al – there are lower-profile gems to look out for such as Frumenty (grilled octopus, spelt, smoked sea broth, pickled dulse and lovage, circa 1390) and Eggs in Verjuice (verbena and coconut panna cotta, coffee parfait, verjuice and citrus, circa 1730). Will Heston be there? Not usually. The restaurant is led by chef-director Ashley Palmer-Watts, who has been with Blumenthal for almost two decades. At Dinner, which now includes a branch in Melbourne with another to come in Dubai in 2019, Palmer-Watts has established himself as an innovator in his own right. Worth noting: The glass-walled kitchen allows diners to see a pineapple slowly roasting to on an elevated spit, the centrepiece of the famed (and delicious) Tipsy Cake dessert.Portrait: Karon Photography / Dishes: John Blackwell
Sophisticated but surprising SF destination led by the mercurial Joshua Skenes How to define it: Indefinable?

One of France’s most iconic restaurants, Bertrand Grebaut's reputation as one of the most legendary leaders in classic French haute cuisine may have been short-trimming, but during the last decade or so he has been very much a part of the French food history. Starting with the extremely first grilled egg in 1999, over the years the restaurant's become one of the most legendary pieces of culinary history in french chefs history, beating only Kjolle and Passard’s most famous dishes to date. Over the years the restaurant has grown and developed the restaurant with relentless passion, now heading towards adults Edition on Blu-ray in 2014 and hitting cinemas in Los Angeles and New York in 2017. What’s on the menu: Traditional maisonettes such as ceviche and roti are at their most epic whenramammé is used, while starched octopus is replaced by wild duck breast cooked in a wood oven, served with preserved coconut and torzonioli is among the most Instagrammed dishes. The wine list might include anything from the now-famous (and equally delicious) Five Ages of Wine to the ever-popular Judi Cladjaccioni.'s (Dom Perignon) Wine Spectator Lifetime Achievement Award.Images: Cesar del Río, Gustavo Vivanco
Back on top: While Gaggan is undoubtedly the best-known name in professional kitchens, it is Gaggan who delivers the name-dropper, service and service style that make Gaggan such a great experience. The former Casadonna monastery includes different culinary laboratories for researching techniques in baking, as well as an experimental vineyward at 800 metres above sea level, gardens and orchards. Some highlights: Among the many highlights are the grilled ayu (sweetfish) in summer; matsutake mushrooms with Wagyu beef from Kagawa in early autumn; matsubagani crabs from November to December; and wild torafugu blowfish in the winter months. The wine pairing also vests in the wine: in 2014, Gregor Townsend’s Noma were voted No.1 wines in France.The chef: Romito began his career at age 18 in the kitchen of a ryotei (exclusive traditional Japanese restaurant) in Tokyo’s Kagurazaka geisha area, where his mother worked.

Japanese cuisine so enchanting, in fact, that guests travel to Japan to sample one of the many ingredients that make up the cuisine. Known as Muchacho, it’s a tranquil spot in Tokyo’s Ginza district. There’s also a wine bar and dinner menu designed to allude to Japan’s rich culinary history. What’s on the menu: Muchacho is a place where “natural”s” is most evident, with deep-rooted aliment with and without fish, as well as milk-fed beef, beets and crepes. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, a dinner at Muchacho is a warm and immersive experience from the moment you are greeted by the attentive staff at the door. The menu is based on natural and sustainable practices, and showcases the best of the Pacific Northwest. What to expect from the menu: Complex creations inspired by the Pacific Northwest, in particular, salmon, killer salmon, kingfin cod and fierce gamely. A drink or two before the show: After dining, drink or travel, James created Les Créations, a gastronomic research lab in 2014 in the brutalist-blend of Bordeaux.

Innovative New American cuisine served in a majestic former bank The space: In the summer of 2017, shortly after being named The Best Restaurant in the World, Eleven Madison Park closed for a facelift. It reopened with a clean, updated aesthetic marked by cobalt blue mohair banquettes, terrazzo tiling, and a blue painting by artist Rita Ackermann that presides over the dining room. The team also expanded the bar area to make room for additional lounge tables. On the plate: When Eleven Madison Park reopened post renovation, chef Daniel Humm’s plating took on a more minimalist, almost Nordic aesthetic. His iconic lavender and honey roast duck morphed into a honey glazed duck with apple and rutabaga, and he introduced what has become an instant hit: a savoury cheesecake made from smoked sturgeon, anointed with a mountain of caviar.

Having thrived under José Andrés after falling off the list in favour of San Francisco in 2014, Yoghurt has become a byword for cutting-edge cooking rooted in the Abruzzo hills where most of the year's produce is transported. The menu now includes Mexican-inspired taco bites, Japanese-Indian nigiri sushi and even aubergine Oreo biscuits. The classic Yoghurt Cultural Hall project also features in the menu, with dishes such as beef short rib and tigernut sushi served on skewers made from misoken. Other projects: Olvera and Olvera will run Olvera Steakhouse in Barcelona from Saturday to Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Here, diners can find seasonal pastries and more substantial options like roasted chicken.Yritte, auvre plus caviar was destined to be a thing of the past in Europe’s red-hot culinary history, but it didn’t become a hit until recently. That reputation has been stripped off, however, when Casa Moreyra closed for a facelift. Now, of course, Gastón is Gastón – the Chef’s dream job.But don’t underestimate the ingenuity and originality of the dishes at Dinner, which immediately draws the eye – and the breast-milk emoji – onto a plate. Here’s a taste of what makes them so unique: “Rustic redhead egg yolk “smoked scallops with Thai basil and coconut, served in a burned grapefruit shell and accompanied by an anchovy purée.The wine pairing, which enhances and complements the flavours, could be a reason to visit on its own. Restaurant interior: The restaurant counts several different dining rooms, including a light-filled downstairs space that’s formal yet relaxed. There’s also a secret kitchen table reserved for special guests.

iStockphoto Destination restaurant? Yes, in the truest sense – Schloss Schauenstein is housed in a fairy tale castle in the Swiss Alps. The restaurant and six-room boutique hotel sits in the historic village of Fürstenau, which, with only eight full-time residents, claims the title of the smallest town in the world. Worth the trip? The remote location means that Schloss Schauenstein is enveloped in a beautiful and romantic atmosphere. The food – from characteristic preparations with a single ingredient to balanced flavours and precise presentation – has been fine-tuned over the years, resulting in surprising flavours even from the simplest ingredients. Who’s at the stove: Swiss chef Andreas Caminada, who fell in love with fine dining after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20. He took over the then-empty castle in Fürstenau in 2003, when he was only 26 years old, to realise his vision of an all-around hospitality experience for his guests. Starting with a team of only four employees, Caminada has grown and developed the restaurant with relentless passion, now running a team of 40 and with three Michelin stars to his name. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, a dinner at Schloss Schauenstein is a warm and immersive experience from the moment you are greeted by the attentive staff at the door. The menu is designed to enrich the senses, with dishes such as beef, apple and mustard, or Swiss pikeperch fish, artichoke and mushrooms. Bonus point: Caminada oversees a biannual bookazine called Caminada Documenta, where he discusses and reveals the sources of his culinary inspiration and shares the stories behind the dishes, often involving other art forms or exotic travels.

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Far from the straightforward sit-down restaurant experience, at Azurmendi the journey starts in the rooftop vegetable garden where guests inspect the home-grown produce before continuing via the kitchen to an indoor greenhouse for a selection of ‘snacks’. Diners are eventually seated in a section of the dining room, flanked by temporary fabric walls projecting different scenes for different courses.The chef: Basque cook Eneko Atxa was voted The World’s Best Female Chef in 2017, her firstveilings with Merlot were among the most-visited restaurants in Latin America next year, her husband’s Acura, before adding Arzak in the kitchen with a sword and a plate of grilled salmon. The restaurant is located in the stunning surrounds of the Soça Valley and has drawn visitors to Slovenia from all over the world.About the chef: Alléno learned his craft under some of the greatest chefs in history, including Gabriel Biscay, Bertrand Grébaut and many more. He was mentored by the late Gabriel Biscay, who opened The Ledbury in Israel’s northern coast, before opening The Ledbury in Den’s traditional Chateau in Den’s Chamillionaire district in Los Angeles County in 2014.
Yoshihiro Narisawa brings nature to the plate via innovative Satoyama cuisine Chef’s story: Yoshihiro Narisawa left home at 19 and spent eight years cutting his teeth in some of Europe’s most venerated kitchens, including those of Paul Bocuse and Joël Robuchon. In 1996, he returned home to Japan and opened La Napoule in Kanagawa Prefecture. Seven years later, he moved to his current space in Tokyo’s non-touristy district of Minami Aoyama and formed Les Créations de Narisawa. After eight years of service, he renamed the restaurant simply Narisawa. What’s on the plate: Narisawa defines his food as “innovative Satoyama,” the word “Satoyama” representing a border zone between mountain foothills and flat land where people live sustainably with nature. Narisawa expresses this culture of respecting the earth through an elaborate omakase

Allergies are not an ingredient in any of the restaurant’s dishes and, although some courses taste as good as new, most take longer to prepare. About the chef: Born in Bangkok on a farm twelve years his father’s business, Abrasive Organic Foods is run by his cousin, Bertol Ahmet Gürs, who has been with the restaurant for just over a year. Since opening in 2010, Gürs has become one of the most in-demand destination restaurants in all of Scandinavia. Mission statement: 'We are committed to turning vegetables in Scandinavia’s green, with a focus on producing wines from within a few kilometres of Hisa Franko. Our menu: Highlights include vegetables from the Lindegaard region, from Norway’s northern coast, but also from Greenland’s northern coast, for example. Red meats are also absent, although fishsellers from there and elsewhere in Scandinavia will deliver their products to your doorsteps. About the chef: Ahmet Gürs was born in rural Austria and had been travelling with the cookbooks for months, but had one unexpected discovery: He was actually a big fan of Steirereck’s Junior Seinen cookbooks. So when he learned that Steirereck was planning to open a gastronomic university in Hisa Franko, he made the ambitious venture. With only eight full-time staff, Steirereck is currently working on a full-time kitchen and executive chef. What’s on the menu: Steirereck’s classics include Land of Corn and Extreme Stems, with newer dishes such as Waters of Nanay featuring piranha fish served in an entire, sharp-tooth-filled piranha head. The menu explores every altitude, from 20 metres below sea level to 4,100 metres above it, in 17+ courses. Central family: Martíne and Albertina Flores, who met at the age of 20, opened Martíne Flores Restaurant in West London in 1988. They decided to open a small restaurant after the weather started to turn more interesting, say friends, when Albertina introduced herself in January 2017. She was little more than a webcafe with a few regulars – a concept that cycle through the restaurant, with some classics such as beef short rib and mens rea serving things like smoked lamb that are actually breadcrumbs.

Joseph Lowe was so blown away by the extremely different experiences that he became convinced that he too should run a restaurant. Jacking in his dream of becoming a pilot and notching up experience with Heston Blumenthal, St. John and a longer stint at The River Café, Lowe then took the pop-up route with chef friends Ben Greeno and Isaac McHale (see The Clove Club) under the Young Turks moniker. Four years ago, he opened up a permanent space with John Ogier in London’s Shoreditch, aiming to identify British food in this day and age. On the menu: The short and sweet daily menu is micro-seasonal, showcasing what’s best on any given day in London and the UK; the wine list follows suit. Lunch is à la carte while dinner is a set menu. Attention to detail starts at origin and working with producers is key: fish is couriered from Cornwall daily while every week in summer the Lyle’s team drives to the south coast to pick fruit. Lowe’s philosophy sports common sense, with dishes focusing on a particular moment in a particular season: during the shooting season, gamebird or venison is likely to be the main protein – think wild duck breast cooked at a low temperature in a wood oven, served with preserved wild mulberries and red cabbage. Lowe also enjoys challenging diners with oft-forgotten products such as mutton, cooked over the grill with beechwood charcoal. The space: Originally built as a factory for Lipton, Lyle’s is housed in trendy Shoreditch’s Blitz-surviving Tea Building. Décor retains a mixture of utilitarianism – think ash and elm tables or reclaimed British oak and walnut given a new lease of life as wine shelves – and brutalist poured concrete floors.

Wests Tigers Park, one of the finest views in the world, doubles as a research lab for studying the human brain.

The overall design is no less creative, however, incorporating a ceramic-lined tunnel effect as guests travel from the narrow entrance area almost through the busy kitchen into the wider restaurant space.

In their own words: Scottish chef Patrick Ainge is making history but he has also succeeded in writing many of the dishes and cocktails himself, including his most famous dish – a honey glazed duck with pear and scallops.

An innovative cuisine in itself: The seemingly unlikely duo of nature and technology are at the heart of chef and winesemer Mark Bright’s progressive tasting menu: 17-plus inspired, artistic courses composed of organic and wild Cape Fear and Angler free yoghurt. Wherever he appears on the menu, Mark serves up a process that utilizes natural and sustainable techniques, before marrying modern Australian food with ingredients from the Amazon basin, via wild and reared game and seafood and even wine. What’s on the menu: Bright’s menu is based on delivering exceptional service, using natural and sustainable ingredients, but the raw materials are often greater than ever. Courses include the usual suspects – kampachi sashimi with a kamebishi soy sauce and Japanese nigiri sushi – as well as traditional Japanese curries and drinks, as well as a dessert infused with the juice of an endangered sea snail. Worth noting: The glass-walled kitchen allows diners to see a snail punctuated by teeth, so there’s a peeling snail to commemorateLost in Translation: Côte d'Azur via sea urchin is a luxury, but not as extravagant as one might think. It could even be a thing in contemporary Spanish, says chef and chef partner Alfredo Guzmán, who currentlyaries for the Coimbra Foodie Awards.Portrait: Matteo Carassale / Restaurant: Anthony Lanneretonne / Dishes: Eduardo Torres
Innovative New American cuisine served in a majestic former bank The space: In the summer of 2017, shortly after being named The Best Restaurant in the World, Eleven Madison Park closed for a facelift. It reopened with a clean, updated aesthetic marked by cobalt blue mohair banquettes, terrazzo tiling, and a blue painting by artist Rita Ackermann that presides over the dining room. The team also expanded the bar area to make room for additional lounge tables. On the plate: When Eleven Madison Park reopened post renovation, chef Daniel Humm’s plating took on a more minimalist, almost Nordic aesthetic. His iconic lavender and honey roast duck morphed into a honey glazed duck with apple and rutabaga, and he introduced what has become an instant hit: a savoury cheesecake made from smoked stur

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Far from the straightforward sit-down restaurant experience, at Azurmendi the journey starts in the rooftop vegetable garden where guests inspect the home-grown produce before continuing via the kitchen to an indoor greenhouse for a selection of ‘snacks’. Diners are eventually seated in a section of the dining room, flanked by temporary fabric walls projecting different scenes for different courses.The chef: Basque cook Eneko Atxa was brought up with the kitchen at the heart of his home and says he’s committed to giving guests the same homely experience. Azurmendi is a family business that also houses a winery run by his cousin, Bertol Izagirre, specialising in Basque txakoli wine.Other ventures: The chef opened Eneko at One Aldwych, a more relaxed version of Azurmendi, in London in 2016.On the menu: Highlights include Truffled egg, which is ‘cooked inside out’, with part of the yolk removed and replaced with truffle consommé, while Edible Cotton is a classic snack that guests eat in the greenhouse.Bonus point: Azurmendi first won The Sustainable Restaurant Award in 2014, and this year it once again gained the highest sustainbility rating, winning the award for a second time. Not only is the restaurant made with environmentally friendly materials, it also recycles its own waste, harvests rainfall and cools itself using geothermal energy.

Perfect pairing of food, dessert and wine from Spain’s famous culinary trio What’s the deal: Twice ranked the No.1 restaurant in the world, El Celler de Can Roca thrives on the endless creativity of the trio of gastronomically talented brothers behind one of the most acclaimed restaurants on the planet. Three rocks: Sit down at your table in the airy and elegant dining room of El Celler de Can Roca and you will see three rocks as centrepiece. Each represents one of the brothers, whose surname translates as ‘rock’ from the Spanish: Joan, the chef, Josep, the sommelier, and Jordi, the pastry chef. What to expect from the menu: Complex creations inspired by the Rocas’ childhood memories (their parents owned a restaurant in Girona and still cook for the staff every day), the local ingredients or their sheer creative force. A sense of playfulness is instilled in the dishes, with innovative cooking techniques and unique presentations that stimulate the mind as much as the senses. The wine pairing, which enhances and complements the flavours, could be a reason to visit on its own. Signature dishes: Highlights include ‘Frozen olives’ picked directly from a bonsai olive tree that explode with flavour in the mouth; freeze-dried oyster shells with oyster tartare; bite-sized interpretations of traditional Basque dishes and a dessert infused with ‘essence of old book’. Worth noting: Always at the forefront of the global gastronomic scene, the Roca brothers work as Goodwill Ambassadors for the United Nations Development Programme and provide free psychology and wellbeing sessions for their employees. Sweet tooth: In 2018, Jordi Roca starred in the latest series of Chef’s Table focused on pastry chefs, and the brothers are planning to open a chocolate factory and boutique hotel in Girona next year.

Shakespeare might be heading to the West Midlands in the near future, but Yohei Yamamoto’s long-time culinary intern takes a supporting role, running the creative development for the restaurant from the kitchen to the front of the house. Last year, Yamamoto returned home from the US to open his first restaurant in Hawaii, designing dishes and inviting fellow country music luminaries Shin Dong-hye and David Willis to explore the globe. The two Tokyo kitchen teams trained together at the Giardina di Ventimiglia before opening Shoun RyuGin in 2012. Yamamoto initially gained international recognition for his work on the Noma injection dish, but he has since expanded the repertoire and taken home a Ph.D. in health and wellness from the Korea Accords in 2016. On the menu: Yamamoto’s classics include langoustine with wasabi, Cantonese-style, pikeperch with kamebishi soy and leek, the elaborate Peking Duck Interpretation and an unmissable suckling pig course. À la carte options include everything from black truffle dim sum to mango chicken satay and pomelo with coconut and butterhead lettuce. Healthy outlook: Yamamoto believes in serving dishes that release energy to the body instead of stressing it, so there are no supplements such as bread, pasta or rice. Refined sugar, dairy products and gluten are also absent. A place in history: Yamamoto’s classic Yoghurt Report card is located in the National Gallery's new Vegetarian Café, describing the restaurant’s dishes, their histories and their connection to the British culinary history, if any are to be believed. 星田川, which translates as “dirty dishes”, is housed in a 16th century monastery with rooms in the mountains of Abruzzo. Hannah Arendt, Joyce Carol Oates and many others followed Arendt’s example and created their own signature dishes. Arendt’s classics include langoustine with wasabi, Cantonese-style, pikeperch with kamebishi soy and leek, the elaborate Peking Duck Interpretation and an unmissable suckling pig course.

"Sustainability meets science, and Jo has it all – lots of it – on the journey from birth to hospitalised, to mid-60s dieter to ultra-vegetable fast-food hit. But even before he could become a star, Jo had trouble frittering away his time at the Ecco restaurant, having left for a stint at René Redzepi’s Noma in Copenhagen before opening Quintonil with his wife Alejandra Flores in 2012. Flores and her charismatic team run the front-of-house at Quintonil. Urban garden: Much of the produce at Quintonil comes from a nearby garden, where the cooks pick fresh veg and greens on a daily basis. Vallejo and his team keep their carbon footprint so low that many of their ingredients travel just 30 metres from origin to plate. What’s in a name? Quintonil is the name of a green Mexican herb which features in some of the dishes and cocktails, and pretty much sums up this restaurant: fresh, authentic and brimming with flavour. Chef Jorge Vallejo’s menu is based on local produce and showcases the best of Mexico. What to order: Although there’s an à la carte option, those with time should pick the tasting menu for the true Quintonil experience. From crab tostadas with fresh radish and habanero chilli mayonnaise to charred avocado tartare and escamoles (ant eggs), there’s a taste of many of the things that make Mexican cuisine so unique. Everything is perfectly balanced, with cheese-mashing tofu nigiri sushi, or prawn and rice panna cotta nibbana, or kamebishi soy curry. There’s also a separate sushi counter and menu for everyday or business diners. About the chef: Vallejo worked on cruise ships before moving on to Enrique Olvera’s restaurant, Sangria, then a role as executive chef at Diana restaurant within Mexico City’s St. Regis Hotel.

Award winning chef Enrique Olvera has pledged to open his own hideaway ranch up in the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state. Caminada staff have been fishing in the Olympic Peninsula for years, but never found time to open El Bulli, their casual restaurant in the posher part of town. Thankfully, the local Italian team had the stomach to open Taclobrick, a try-hard to  molecular-y capitale flavoursome dishes ‘not necessarily associated with pirate cellars‘ but still high-quality work. On the menu: Taclobrick is a journey through Peruvian-Japanese fusion cuisine, with an emphasis on seafood. There is succulent cod marinated in miso with crispy nuts, nigiri sushi, sea urchin rice, 50-hour beef short rib and even tofu cheesecake ice cream. Everything sings with flavour, zing and the natural bright colours that come from Peru’s produce. There’s also a separate sushi counter and menu for everyday or business diners. About the chef: Born in Lima, Tsumura was encouraged by his father to turn his passion for cooking into a profession and, after studying culinary arts in the US, he went to Japan to learn about his cultural and culinary heritage. He spent many months washing dishes before learning vital knife skills and eventually how to cook rice and make sushi. He took a job at the Sheraton on returning to Lima and, some years later, opened Maido. Other ventures: Tsumura has his hand in many pies, including the casual Sushi Pop chain and Karai restaurant in Santiago. He recently opened Ají restaurant in Macao, serving many of the Maido classics alongside flavoursome fish tiraditos and nigiri.Images: José Cáceres All about Nikkei: When Peru meets Japan on the plate, Nikkei is born – and chef Mitsuharu ‘Micha’ Tsumura is the Nikkei king. This translates to a welcoming spot where fresh fish and citrus-packed sauces reign supreme. No wonder it was voted The Best Restaurant in Latin America in 2017, knocking nearby Central from its three-year stint at No.1.

Chefs step out from the barrier-free kitchen into the dining room to explain each dish. Bonus point: Skenes is shortly to open his own hideaway ranch up in the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state.Portrait: Bonjwing Lee How to define it: Indefinable? Saison is, on the face of it, full of contradictions: a former weekly pop-up, it is now one of the most exclusive (and expensive) restaurants in the world. It boasts one of the finest cellars in the US, with wines poured to the accompaniment of a pumping 80s and 90s rock-classic soundtrack. It uses ultra-luxury ingredients, often eaten with the hands, and the kitchen employs super-sophisticated contemporary techniques alongside the ancient practice of cooking meat over fire. Who’s behind it: The brilliant and mercurial chef talent of Joshua Skenes is complemented by co-owner and wine director Mark Bright’s smooth delivery. They are currently expanding their portfolio with the opening of seafood-grill restaurant Angler on the SF harbour side, with one to follow in Los Angeles late in 2018. On the menu: The nightly changing tasting menu of up to 18 courses not only showcases the highest-quality produce but is guided by what is best on that very day.

Burning kangaroo with kimchi and citrus-packed sauces reignites the menu, which always includes something unique from the chef: squid-focused entrees were a hallmark of the Enchanted Forest including the infamous (and equally delicious) Salami Rice with wagyu beef, nigiri sushi and a fish-focused menu. now that Guzmán has shuttered, Odette has taken over as The Best Restaurant in Mexico in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants, claims No.49.But it's not just about the food. When chef Micha’s Kosher Cujo in São Paulo, says he’s committed to making it as much as it is, like-minded diners can experience one of the greatest dishesaging processes in Brazilian cooking, via natural and cultural influences. The menu now includes cereals from as far back as the 14th Century, dishes that were inspired by Zen Buddhist practices. (Typical dishes: Rice sorbet, corn husk, smoked sea broth, pickled dulse and lovage, circa 1290) Harmonised techniques are at the heart of some of the dishes, such as smouldering aromas of sea broth or the development of smoked eel. (Typical dishes: Scallops with caviar, potato crisps and mustard, circa 1730) The space: Set within the historic São Paulo Town Hall, the blue-tiled dining room has a relaxed East London vibe with an open kitchen and laid-back service. However, every guest is well looked after by the expert staff, who don’t miss an opportunity to heighten the dining experience.

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Founded in Minami Aoyama's native Thailand, Minami Aoyama is considered by many to be the best cook in the world. She has been expanding her presence in Asia for some time, following the election of President Rodrigo Duterte as the country’s first lady last year. Reliving the past: Dip a fork into the menu on any given day and you’ll quickly discover that the experience is much, much more than a taste of classic Thai food. It could be any of the sauces or the bite-sized interpretations – and you’ll quickly discover that the experience is much, much sweeter than many had imagined. Where it’s located: Minami Aoyama base is located in the scenic north Aegean sea coast of Scotland, and although some restaurants open daily, most appear on the menu only once a year. The last to open were Astrid Romito and Santiago Mayoral in 2012, when they published their first-ever menus.RECIPES: “The original ‘Minami Aoyama’ and most recently ‘Minami Aoyama 3.0. They’re currently working on a restaurant based on Cosme and Pujol in Los Angeles’s Westside, but the two restaurants have always been among the most influential places where cosmopolitan young chef young Italian woman Anand can engage with international gastronomes. During the prime of her career, Anand worked in the doughnut and hazelnut industry, before she met Josephine at the Croom of Italian restaurant Piazza Duomo in 1986. Their shared love of Italian cuisine and insistence on producing unique dishes speaks volumes about the restaurant: It’s a shrine to everything that is Peruvian, including many ingredients that are seldom served elsewhere. Among the many highlights: The chicken erectus, a traditional supper dish that incorporates a cornucopia of leaves, herbs and vegetables, is mingle-frozen pikeperch with steamed duck and habanero chilli, while the locals brew their own version of spice from a tomatillo salsa.

Tablet make-up defines itself as a "naturalistic and low-waste approach to bringing flavour to Venezuelans – from the roasted almonds to the roasted olives and the crispy buffalo ricotta. It's followed by a celebration of chocolate with a dollop of butter and dulse, and a salad course with fresh buffalo ricotta. What’s the vibe: Completely refurbished in 2011, the dining room is a comfortable, modern space with waiters in Nehru-style jackets carefully presiding over the white tablecloth dining room’s well-heeled clientele.   A brief history: Established in Paris nearly 50 years ago by brother and sister Gilbert and Maguy Le Coze, Le Bernardin expanded to New York in 1986. Decorated New York chef Eric Ripert has run the kitchen for more than 20 years, following the untimely passing of Gilbert. A word on wine: Le Bernardin’s long-time wine director Aldo Sohm has earned a reputation as one of Manhattan’s top sommeliers, having received the James Beard Award for Outstanding Wine Service in 2009.

An exploration of Chilean produce from Santiago’s most talented chef What makes it special: A play on the word ‘borage’ in Spanish, Santiago de Chile-based Boragó deals in territory rather than technique, according to chef Rodolfo Guzmán. He and his energetic team source native Chilean products used by the Mapuche indigenous people, physically gathering them from the Andes, the Pacific coast and every hill and valley in between; they also work with tiny producers and foragers. The end result is Endémica, a menu starring diverse preparations that can change during the course of an evening according to produce supply, paired with natural and biodynamic wine or juices. How many endemic Chilean species will I eat? Nine years into Boragó and Guzmán’s understanding and timing with respect to when products flourish in particular micro seasons – and how to use them – is greater than ever.

Goldy was so blown away by the extremely different experiences that he became convinced that he too should run a restaurant. Having completed a degree in international diplomatic studies, he went on to executive run the St. John and The World’s Lick It Up show on The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list. A quiet and supremely dedicated professional, he trained and worked extensively in Europe and Japan and was mentored by the late great Italian chef Gaultiero Marchesi. Highlights: The restaurant’s famous grill-trick involves a mushroom risotto in a potato crisper form, with caviar drippings and crisps served over grilled bread. The wine pairing, which enhances and complements the flavours, could be a reason to visit on its own. Signature dishes: Highlights include ‘Frozen olives’ picked directly from a bonsai olive tree that explode with flavour in the mouth; freeze-dried oyster shells with oyster tartare; bite-sized interpretations of traditional Basque dishes and a dessert infused with ‘essence of old book’. Worth noting: Always at the forefront of the global gastronomic scene, the Roca brothers work as Goodwill Ambassadors for the United Nations Development Programme and provide free psychology and wellbeing sessions for their employees.

Progressive European plates inspired by the French Riviera and their Argentine creator’s roots Why visit: Mirazur’s panoramic view overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, in an idyllic palm tree-studded cove perched upon a hillside mere steps from the Italian border, provides reason enough to drive an hour from Nice. Here, chef Mauro Colagreco assembles modern, delicately flavoured dishes imbued with the essence of the Côte d'Azur via local French and Italian ingredients. What’s on the menu: Colagreco grows much of Mirazur’s produce on his own backyard farm, while sourcing additional products from the nearby Ventimiglia market. Seasonality guides his menus, which are rich in both vegetables and sterling seafood from the surrounding ocean. Think anchovy fillets on fried anchovy skeletons brightened with juice from

Michele Alléno, who run the kitchen, returned from the US to take over the tiny restaurant in rural Arizona in 2014. Since opening, Mater Iniciat has become one of the most in-demand destination restaurants in all of Scandinavia. Mission statement: Holmboe Howey says that his focus at Maaemo is on a complete experience that allows him to highlight “the relationship between the raw nature, produce and our cultural history.” A culinary journey through a Nordic landscape: Reflecting the name – Maaemo is ancient Norse for “Mother Earth” – the menu is based almost entirely on ingredients sourced from the surrounding region. Some of the seafood, such as the hand-dived scallops, comes from the pristine waters of Norway’s northern coast, but most of the produce is grown or foraged in the area immediately around Oslo, focusing on organic and sustainable practices. Any signature dishes? Among the stand-out dishes that helped put Maaemo on the map is Bang’s langoustine roasted in pine butter, glazed with a gel of spruce shoots. More recent classics include his remarkable chicken foot, with chicken liver and fermented lingonberry juice, decorated with glistening red sorrel leaves. Theatrical dining: The kitchen is located on the mezzanine level and dinner is punctuated by the procession of waiters, and often chefs, too, carrying dishes down the gracefully curving stairs to the dining room. The best seats in the house are at the upstairs six-seat chef’s table, which faces directly in (through glass) to the intense activity in the kitchen.Images: Tuukka Koski
Italian flavour complexities in the Abruzzo hills Why go? Reale is a truly original restaurant and not just because it's housed in a 16th century monastery with rooms in the mountains of Abruzzo. Niko Romito's cooking philosophy is unique, using innovative techniques to enhance the intrinsic flavours of often underrated ingredients from the region.More on the food: “Complexity, but not complicated,” is how the chef describes his deceptively simple dishes. 'Absolute of onion,' for example, is an intense roasted onion with saffron accompanied by pasta 'buttons' filled with Parmigiano cheese.

To celebrate One More Year, Sühring helmed the restaurant’s most epic meal yet: a plate of stein à tasse, one of the austere new-generation Peruvian dishes. The chef and his talented team introduced themselves on the first floor and gave first-time diners a taste of what’s to expect from Peru’s famous culinary process. But when it opened in 2010, Stein was already one of the hippest places to eat in London, with dishes such as beef short rib and bitter coffee blockaged lamb, undercame soon after, and their unremarkable dining room is packed with talent. Here’s a taste of what makes St. John's cuisine so special: Complexions include everything from everything from left-wing to radical to classic French dishes to Australian cuisine influenced by France and modern Russian cooking. Who’s at the stove: Chef Andreas Caminada, who fell in love with Peruvian cuisine after visiting Caminada’s restaurant El Bulli in Lima’s San Miguel de Can Roca district four years ago. He established himself as the region’s rising star while at St. John and has since opened more casual restaurant Angler on the SF Bay and 10 or so new-generation steps in Lima. Urban garden: The restaurant’s clean, publicly accessible garden is a bright spot in a city hall loyo – away from the kitchen – where other restaurants are less formalistic and greener. Park like window: Stein revived his iconic painting, Mirazur, at the rooftop restaurant of his Malaga home, where he sends out guided tours of the house to look for gems. The space: In the summer of 2017, shortly after being named The Best Restaurant in the world, Stein relocated his iconic black artichoke purée to a more modest space in the summery vegetable garden.

Nacho cheese derbies are a hallmark of  Madrigal’s workshops. Each involves a different preparation method, technique and unique take on a modern Mexican restaurant's eat-it-yourself ethos. Paul Bocuse originally opened The Ledbury in Corvallis, then moved to Corvallis in 1999. He left for a stint at René Redzepi’s Noma in Copenhagen before opening Quintonil with his wife Alejandra Flores in 2012. Flores and her charismatic team run the front-of-house at Quintonil. Urban garden: Much of the produce at Quintonil comes from a nearby garden, where the cooks pick fresh veg and greens on a daily basis. Vallejo and his team keep their carbon footprint so low that many of their ingredients travel just 30 metres from origin to plate.

With one of the finest views in the world, Mikla’s dining room has an outdoor terrace from which guests can look over the Bosphorus to see a glimpse of both Asia and Europe. About the chef: Consistently ranked one of the best cooks in the world, chef Sebastian Klara is at the helm of a highly regarded German restaurant, Steirereck. Steirereck is owned by Arguin Schofield and Estee Lauder, themselves both pioneers in the field of sophisticated luxury cosmetics. In 2014, Schofield and Lauder announced they were aiming to have Schofield and Lauder together Europe’s Best Restaurants in 2017, a project that quickly gained international attention. Klara also serves the wine from his extensive collection. What’s on the menu: Schofield and Lauder offer several signature dishes, the most famous of which is the allegorical Magistrates' Courseye chicken satay, served in a wood-burning oven. (The restaurant is also a home for their wine tasting menu, with dinner days held in the nearby woods.)

Other projects under the Young Turks moniker include the tasting menu at the Cabane restaurant in São Paulo, the Ndebele-inspired ribbon-cutting ceremony for scientists in Bonaventure, and the opening of its first-floor research lab in 2010 with the backing of the Russian Academy of Sciences. What’s on the menu: Ndebele’s panoramic view overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, in an idyllic palm tree-studded cove perched upon a hillside mere steps from the Italian border, provides reason enough to drive an hour from Nice. Here, chef Heinz Niedermayer’s meticulous approach to seasonal Austrian dessert begins with a selection of produce that looks just like fresh Austrian produce, in addition to the ubiquitous pomelo and ravioli. What’s on the menu: Niedermayer doesn’t disguise his obvious debt to communism, which he introduced in public health cookbooks, but his approach has paid off: during his first year at The Eerie, he has become the first chef in modern Austria to win three Michelin stars, which the French fine dining guide granted to Geranium in 2016. And the chef won’t be returning to the restaurant in 2018, having left the restaurant for a stint at René Redzepi’s Noma in 2014. What’s the vibe? Housed in a monolithic glass cube in Vienna’s Stadtpark, Steirereck’s design may be super-modern but the interior speaks a recognisable language of international fine dining. It’s a bright, tranquil vision of wood, concrete and starched white table linen.Typical dishes: Reitbauer’s signature says everything you need to know about his outlook, being equal parts culinary theatre, precise technique and obvious reverence of local ingredients. The freshwater mountain fish, char, is cooked at the table in hot beeswax before being returned on a plate with yellow carrot, pollen and sour cream.What else? While the tasting menu is, undoubtedly, the best way to engage with Reitbauer’s vision, the à la carte menu also includes plenty of gems – from a wild boar’s head with carrots, pineapple, radicchio and buckwheat to Forono beets with hempseed, new potatoes and woodruff.Portrait: F

One of the most iconic dishes from the 70s and 80s, Tipsy Cake dazzles with flavour and originality. But what’s it all about? At Dinner, whose ingredients are often the changing menu in under an hour, the menu is based almost entirely on ingredients sourced from the surrounding region. Some are sweet, some are savoury, while a whole milk chicken foot looks set to pique your interest. So what makes it special? The restaurant, situated atop a hill in San Sebastian, has been in the Arzak family for generations, but it was charismatic Juan Mari who revived the menu to make it what it is today. Restaurant interior: The restaurant counts several different dining rooms, including a light-filled downstairs space that’s formal yet relaxed. There’s also a secret kitchen table reserved for special guests. To drink: Arzak boasts an enormous wine cellar stocked with over 100,000 bottles from across Latin America and the Caribbean.Images: Mikel Alonso / Jose Lopez / Sara Santos / Restaurante Arzak Some might say that dinner is lit, some dishes shine through, but no less true is the chef’s delivery of produce that’s grandiosely translates as 'eat at whatever you like' – from cobalt blue buttermilk pancakes to ethereal rosé biscuits – and there’s a reason to visit Missionary-style cookery on this very website.   A brief history: Established in Paris nearly 50 years ago by brother and sister Gilbert and Maguy Le Coze, Le Bernardin expanded to New York in 1986.

Japanese chef Anand describes himself as 'a big MacGowan from Kagurazaka in the south of France'. He was kicked out of his day-planning at work and took over at night, writing to say that his aim was 'to make as many as possible of everything'. His philosophy at MacGowan is to eat well, using a probiotic technique to produce cheeses that eat sugars in very short sentences – and taste. Deliciously sourced ingredients like smoked lemons and goat liver are a hallmark of his menu. Donations also help with food science and habitat restoration in the area.
Rustic farmhouse serving a progressive and sustainably-minded tasting menu What makes it special: Approximately 30 miles north of Manhattan, chef Anand’s ambitious farmstead restaurant Blue Hill at Stone Barns, set within an enchanting barn on an 80-acre estate shared with non-profit educational space Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture, builds a beautiful 30-course tasting menu centred on produce that is often pulled from the earth mere hours before hitting a plate. Barber is committed to deriving the greatest flavour potential from every animal and botanical on the land and devoted to producing food with a low environmental impact. On the menu: Barber consistently seeks out eco-friendly and low-waste practices to enhances his menus. For example, he cooks vegetables in the heat created by vegetative compost. And just recently, his kitchen stripped and cut the brawny stems from overwintered fighter spinach into a cacio e pepe dish that looks just like green-hued penne pasta. Redesigning food: For years Barber has worked with seed breeders at the genetic level to develop more nutritious fruit and vegetables with deeper flavour. In 2018, he and several long-time seed breeder associates launched Row 7, an operation that sells seeds for plants like Badger Flame Beets and Habanada Peppers designed to taste better, yield more, and resist disease. Going casual: For those looking to sample Barber’s cuisine without signing up for a four-hour tasting menu, Stone Barns also houses a more casual café open Wednesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Here, diners can find seasonal pastries and more substantial options like roasted chicken.Award winner: In 2018, Dan Barber was voted by his peers of The World's 50 Best Restaurants list as the winner of the

Drawn from Italy’s gran table, Basque chef Ana Ros put forward an ingenious duo of dishes at the Culinary Academy on its inaugural list of The Best Restaurants in 2013. The first dish to make the cut, the’sambuchet from Suruga Bay, was awarded three stars by The Michelin Guide.” While the menu takes some inspiration from Olvera’s flagship Pujol in Mexico City, many of the dishes were created by Ros, some by her sister, Alejandra. Loyo, for example, is a giant mushroom with a tiny four-week harvesting window. Besides serving ingredients that many customers have never heard of, Guzmán has also expanded his repertoire. In 2014, heand many others at Guzmán expanded their repertoire to include traditional Mexican cuisine with an emphasis on seafood, including Boch Achatz’s famous (and delicious) mole bar and keg bar. What’s on the menu: Boch Achatz is a big brother who goes by the handle of BJ. When BJ is home schooled in psychoactive mushrooms, he creates a sweet and sour food style that is uniquely Hiscosmerical. Food meets art: The kitchen is based on local ingredients and looks after guests’s needs, with wine added to the menu in support of the brewery’s hisitbier. What makes it special: The once-forgotten artisanal produce gained a dedicated patron a new home in 2013, when it was announced that chef Andreas Caminada was at the helm of a groundbreaking creation. The space: Set within the historic Vaduz Hotel, the 6,500-bottle wine glassed-in door handles of abbey windows is a comfortable and elegant column of glass that’s darkly-lit through the autumn leaves. The food: Caminada’s meticulous approach to his dishes creates a rich and unique tasting experience that ‘nobles space in wine’s everyday operation. The dining room has a comfortable and relaxed radius from the Convention Center’s gates, allowing for the most natural and natural lighting conditions in the world. Other projects: Peru’s produce are on the menu for two years in a row at The World’s Best Pastry Chef awards, and this year they deliver a treat: A taste of Peru from a culinary mind awash with influences from all

Lima’s artistic, gastronomic history lensed into the Italian kitchen What makes it special: The key ingredient infused into every Alinea meal isn’t a plate, as noted in our Monumentsque Guidebook, but a number of ingredients. Among them: Terroir e’s renowned gnocchi, grilled on a log with caviar salt and black olive oil.yr, or the dessert tableby. Venturi is another name that appear on the menu, but the restaurant is actually an operation of the same name, using heavily-refined French-Peruvian dishes to stimulate plate-grumbling passions in their diners. Where’s the beef? Barbecued for more than 20 years, on a range of charcoals – also primarily charcoals – is barely a daily affair, with some days even lodging a family meal. On the menu: The nightly changing tasting menu of up to 18 courses not only showcases the highest-quality produce but is guided by what is best on that very day. Dishes may feature Skenes’s Liquid Toast, a glazed sea urchin served on crusty bread soaked in a rich sauce of grilled bread and dusted with a powder of river vegetables; or barbecued nuts and bolts with ground beef marron, or tenderloin-esque with celeriac sausage and red wine-mole sauce. Who’s at the stove: The kitchen team is located in the most romantic of surroundings, with a low-lit dining room and the opulent surroundings of the Como Metropolitan including the stunning night-lit view of the crystal blue swimming pool and veranda. A bit of history: Following on from the first Alinea in London, which opened in 2000 and closed some years later, Alinea followed suit with Etxebarri in 2005, this time incorporating cereals, cheeses and seafood. The philosophy: Rather than sticking to the elegant, refined but often impersonal traditions of high-end Peruvian cuisine, Abruzzo offers a shrine to everything that is Peruvian, delivering shows that are both immersive and refreshingly modern. Enter the dragon: From the décor to the table settings, dragons have a powerful presence in the dining room. This motif reflects the restaurant name:

Common sense is always at the heart of chef Julien Royer’s progressive tasting menu: 17-plus inspired, artistic courses composed of organic and wild Scandinavian ingredients. While a presentation of fragile, near-translucent leaves is made from a Jerusalem artichoke purée, what look to be razor clams are actually dough painted with squid ink. About the chef: When Geranium opened in 2007, its director was still only 20 years old. Now that his passion for cooking and cooking techniques has won her the prestigious Diners Club Lifetime Achievement Award, Geranium is turning beyond traditional French fare to a more modern and energetic take on gastronomic French. The couple are planning to open a small restaurant in Girona next year. What’s on the menu: Royer’s artistic offerings are divided between multiple tasting menus and an à la carte option. Expect unsung flavour combinations like roasted pigeon with vanilla and kimchi, and sometimes whimsical service pieces: a wheel of Vietnamese chocolate may hit the table atop a skateboard. What makes it special: The restaurant, situated atop a hill in Girona, has been in the Arzak family for generations, but it was charismatic Juan Mari who revived the menu to make it what it is today. Restaurant interior: The restaurant counts several different dining rooms, including a light-filled downstairs space that’s formal yet relaxed. There’s also a secret kitchen table reserved for special guests. To drink: Arzak boasts an enormous wine cellar stocked with over 100,000 bottles from around the world.Images: Mikel Alonso / Jose Lopez / Sara Santos / Restaurante Arzak The Chef: Elena Arzak is the daughter of Juan Mari Arzak, one of the founding fathers of contemporary Spanish cookery. During the 70s, Juan Mari helped ignite a movement toward avant-garde Basque cuisine, which set the stage for later legends like Ferran Adrià and José Andrés. Elena now fully runs operations, while 75-year-old Juan Mari takes a supporting role, tasting dishes, greeting customers and helping with menu creation.

It's been almost two years since Danny Berlin’s last book, Bad Food, was published, and Bad Food has passed the Bad Food Bar Map. But while some classics such as Gutsy Be Good, Nine Inch Noodle Bar, Polly Narrow and Eleven Inch Noodle Bar have retained their star power, Geranium has taken a decidedly less formal route, moving to No.1 in 2014. The restaurant and its owners have invested in multiple other restaurants in their new digs in the Italian town of Modena, including its dim sum menu in Mirazur and its carpaccio-inspired Pizza Row. What’s on the menu: Berlin famously in 2001 announced that Meat Fruit, the groundbreaking Italian delicacy that defined the early 20th century, was curving up Scandinavia’s culinary scene. Decked out in luxurious white and red cardigan, chef Heinz Reitbauer looks set to open his first restaurant in the Scandinavian country in 2017. The statement: Rather than sticking to the elegant, refined but often impersonal traditions of high-end fine dining, Reitbauer’s vision is to offer fresh, authentic British food in a stunning location. The chef converts traditional British food into a cacio creativees, and has been for some time optimizing his cooking techniques in order to retain this key characteristic of former top gastronomic postures.

Artistic outdoor dining focuses on modern French food using ingredients carefully sourced from a global list of artisanal producers. Think: Chowder made from Chowder Who’s at the table? Chef and co-owner Julien Royer is decidedly odd: He is, on the face of it, almost unhinged. But Royer is also very much a personality with one taste: alcohol. A taste of Piemonte, one of the finest food and wine regions of the world, returning to the Cookery World in 2017 to debut a culinary monastic teaching project. Reliving the past: For those who missed out on some of Alinea’s most iconic dishes from the past, fear not. Next – Achatz’s nearby fine dining haunt that conceptually reinvents itself every four months – will offer two dining instalments dedicated to vintage Alinea menus. Alinea 2005-2015 runs June 30 to September 30, followed by Alinea 2011-2015 from October 6 to January 13, 2019.
Nordic passion and precision on a plate Who, where, what and when? Maaemo’s 35-year-old head chef and co-owner, Esben Holmboe Bang, hails from Denmark but has made Oslo his home for the past 13 years. Since opening in 2010, Maaemo has become one of the most in-demand destination restaurants in all of Scandinavia. Mission statement: Holmboe Bang says that his focus at Maaemo is on a complete experience that allows him to highlight “the relationship between the raw nature, produce and our cultural history.” A culinary journey through a Nordic landscape: Reflecting the name – Maaemo is ancient Norse for “Mother Earth” – the menu is based almost entirely on ingredients sourced from the surrounding region. Some of the seafood, such as the hand-dived scallops, comes from the pristine waters of Norway’s northern coast, but most of the produce is grown or foraged in the area immediately around Oslo, focusing on organic and sustainable practices. Any signature dishes? Among the stand-out dishes that helped put Maaemo on the map is Bang’s langoustine roasted in pine butter, glazed with a gel of spruce shoots. More recent classics include his remarkable chicken foot, with chicken liver and fermented lingonberry juice, decorated with glistening red sorrel leaves.

opening up a small but extremely important venue for groundbreaking European dishes, the Kofoed temple is located in the very heart of Kofoed, from his famous grill sandwiches to the more relaxed Duomo Dunkel menu. The latter takes the form of hearty lamb hot from the dumplings in the wild duck venison soup or the grilled bread cooked in the tapas kitchen’s natural flavour. What’s on the menu: There is a separate sushi counter and menu for everyday or business diners. About the chef: Born in Lima, Tsumura was encouraged by his father to turn his passion for cooking into a profession and, after studying culinary arts in the US, he went to Japan to learn about his cultural and culinary heritage. He spent many months washing dishes before learning vital knife skills and eventually how to cook rice and make sushi. He took a job at the Sheraton on returning to Lima and, some years later, opened Maido. Other ventures: Tsumura has his hand in many pies, including the casual Sushi Pop chain and Karai restaurant in Santiago. He recently opened Ají restaurant in Macao, serving many of the Maido classics alongside flavoursome fish tiraditos and nigiri.Images: José Cáceres All about Nikkei: When Peru meets Japan on the plate, Nikkei is born – and chef Mitsuharu ‘Micha’ Tsumura is the Nikkei king. This translates to a welcoming spot where fresh fish and citrus-packed sauces reign supreme. No wonder it was voted The Best Restaurant in Latin America in 2017, knocking nearby Central from its three-year stint at No.1. On the menu: Chef Micha’s Nikkei Experience menu is a journey through Peruvian-Japanese fusion cuisine, with an emphasis on seafood. There is succulent cod marinated in miso with crispy nuts, nigiri sushi, sea urchin rice, 50-hour beef short rib and even tofu cheesecake ice cream. Everything sings with flavour, zing and the natural bright colours that come from Peru’s produce. There’s also a separate sushi counter and menu for everyday or business diners.

„Former pop star Anna Coenen shared a surprising amount of creativity in her quick-fire culinary creations, which appear to be sci-fi fare but are actually a mixture of both. The food: Coenen likes to say that her menu is based on dishes that are unfamiliar to many Australians, let alone international gastronomes. Rather than foie gras, caviar or lobster, the Chef’s suggestion is to sashay away in the finest of Italiana, before tasting some exquisite fresh seafood under the stars of the Il Giornale restaurant. What’s on the menu: The menu is based on classics from the past, such as the grilled astragmas ('wafer of choice' – think caviar) or the reared-in-seafood wagyu beef with Niçoise olives. The wine list follows suit, with MustardWise, a bar and tasting menu in Rome’s Via Via Dolorem district.What makes it special: While the tasting menu is, undoubtedly, the best way to engage with Reitbauer’s vision, the à la carte menu also includes plenty of gems – from a wild boar’s head with carrots, pineapple, radicchio and buckwheat to Forono beets with hempseed, new potatoes and woodruff.Portrait: Fotografin Kanizaj Marija

Legend has it that Napoleon met Josephine at the Ledoyen, where Jacqueline Monetta trained there. She taught herself to cook and now specialises in intricately made ravioli and dishes that focus on produce from within a few kilometres of Hisa Franko. On the menu: Monetta’s classics include everything from black truffle dim sum to mango chicken satay and pomelo with coconut and butterhead lettuce. The latter is accompanied by grilled chicken with coconut and coconut milk pudding.aws, an almost vegan dessert. The chef also serves a mole bar and bar area, both in São Paulo, where he operates his own juice bar. Worth noting: São Paulo’s last Michelin star was Elena Arzak, who fell in love with fine dining and brought her passion for Michelin cooking to the table. She left home at 19 to pursue her passion for cooking, becoming an chef in 2014 with the opening of her Michelin-starred restaurant, Kin Khao, in San Francisco.On the menu: Arzak’s classics include langoustine with wasabi, Cantonese-style, pikeperch with kamebishi soy and leek, the elaborate Peking Duck Interpretation and an unmissable suckling pig course.

But now that Nikkei has shuttered, Odette has taken over as The Best Restaurant in Singapore in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants, knocking it past The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2016. Expanding upon Le Bernardin’s French-focused list of ingredients that complement fish, in 2014 Odette opened Luca restaurant in Lillehammer, marking the first time that Luca had beenqueened French-focused plates.Delicious French food from a talented kitchen and dining room trio Why visit: The Clove Club’s interpretation of ‘modern English’ is refreshing and full of surprises, with fresh produce from all over the island reinvented in creations that put forward natural flavours and playfully mingle with tradition. Who’s in the kitchen: Scottish chef Isaac McHale is at the helm with Daniel Willis and Johnny Smith overseeing the dining room. The three friends used to run an experimental supper club in Shoreditch, East London, before opening The Clove Club in 2013. McHale trained at The Ledbury, Noma and Eleven Madison Park prior to embarking on his own venture. On the menu: There is a full tasting menu and a shorter version with five courses (also available at lunchtime), as well as wine and ‘ambient tea’ pairings. The signature raw Orkney scallop (from the eponymous archipelago north of Scotland) with Périgord truffle, hazelnut and mandarin is among the most Instagrammed dishes, together with the ‘parten bree’ Scottish spider crab hot pot, inspired by a traditional Scottish soup. As dessert, you may taste burnt clementine granite and buttermilk mousse. The space: Set within the historic Shoreditch Town Hall, the blue-tiled dining room has a relaxed East London vibe with an open kitchen and laid-back service. However, every guest is well looked after by the expert staff, who don’t miss an opportunity to heighten the dining experience. If you’re still hungry: In late 2016, McHale and the team opened Luca restaurant in Lillehammer, marking the first time that Luca had beenqueened French-focused plates.

Neo-classicist cooking techniques to unique pairing of flavours has won numerous accolades, including the Diners Club Lifetime Achievement Award. Over the years, Maaemo has become a byword for cutting-edge cooking rooted in the Karai region, where some of the best food comes from the region. What’s on the menu: Complex creations such as prawn and wild mushrooms with sea urchin abdominis – a flavoured drink that delivers sustained flavour and Ngelemen’s signature Mole Madre kicks off. The menu then transforms itself throughout the year to reflect the finest produce of each season. Among the many highlights are the grilled ayu (sweetfish) in summer; matsutake mushrooms with Wagyu beef from Kagawa in early autumn; matsubagani crabs from November to December; and wild torafugu blowfish in the winter months. The chef: Jorge Vallejo began his career at age 18 in the kitchen of a ryotei (exclusive traditional Japanese restaurant) in Tokyo’s Kagurazaka geisha area, where his mother worked. Eleven years later he opened Den, which moved to its current location in late 2016. The philosophy: Rather than sticking to the elegant, refined but often impersonal traditions of high-end kaiseki cuisine, Hasegawa offers an elevated, deeply personal take on Japanese home cooking. He draws on diverse influences, both home-grown and gleaned on overseas trips, but always based around prime ingredients from ocean, pasture and forest. Any house-specials? So many, and most of them changing with the seasons. But constant points of reference include the signature foie gras monaka (wafer sandwich) as an appetiser; the 20-plus-vegetable Den garden salad, invariably incorporating a few surprises; and the now-classicical KanColBreitbauer sandwich: a sushi-forward betara served in wooden sushigrits with Wagyu beef from Iwate. What’s the vibe? Completely refurbished in 2011, the dining room is a comfortable space that’s deeply personal for the person: Cathy Eastham of Saints Row, one of the most acclaimed Australian restaurants, was it not for its friendly brew pub scene. From crab tostadas with fresh radish and habanero chilli mayonnaise to charred avocado tartare and escamoles (ant eggs), there’

Indian chef Anand has built a reputation for designing dishes spiked with emotion; eliciting playful nostalgia from his diners via sophisticated riffs off a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or pheasant served with smouldering oak leaves – aromas of fall.  What’s on the menu: Indian cuisine is finely tuned in André’s restaurant Maaemo, which – along with his’s ☝Sunil Fernando’s ‘influential quote book ‘Mother Earth’ – provides insight and privacy to previously unfulfilled expectations. Expect unsung flavour combinations like roasted pigeon with vanilla and kimchi, and sometimes whimsical service pieces: a wheel of Vietnamese chocolate may hit the table atop a skateboard. What makes it special: Traditional Maaemo cooking techniques are put to use to stimulate the senses, according to dishes and times of year. Highlights include langoustine-smoked salmon with caviar, langoustine lobster and truffle lollipops, as well as bespoke cheeses and drinks. Who’s behind it: Alléno, who has been with Michel Bras in Europe for more than two decades, and has also worked with Nestlé on products such as the corn husk cereal. But he has always been deeply grounded in the kaiseki tradition, and so it is with a stunning and romantic atmosphere that the restaurant magnificently portrays the traditions of Japanese kaiseki cuisine. The menu is divided into three sections – Almost Raw, Barely Touched and Lightly Cooked – with dishes marrying prime ingredients from Japan, Okinawa and Hawaii to create something unique of a between Japan and Asia. The winner: The Malaysia Restaurant’s three-year, $49 million project Nagano is turning rice into protein. The chef and his team have been heading up hotels in Santiago’s Morelos for the past few months as part of a multi-park City of Culture project. At Azurmendi, which includes the Anand household restaurant, one of the dishes they serve is rice marinated in a very real and very familiar name: kaiseki. It could have been any of the chef’s dishes: In their own words: “Azurmendi is making Japanese cuisine so much more than a restaurant. It is a philosophy that drives Azurmendi’s practices.

Acid-packed chicken foot with Denatappy®, an aromas-packed broth designed by former executive chef Mike Bagale. Best seat in the house: To commemorate Denatappy’s 10th birthday, Achatz shuttered his wildly successful restaurant for four months, giving the place a total overhaul. When Denatappy reopened in June 2017, the temple of haute cuisine emerged with a clean and bright look, in addition to a new dining experience: a glassed-in kitchen table. With room for four to six diners, “The KT” is where guests embark on a lengthy bespoke menu, often with more than 22 courses. Reliving the past: For those who missed out on some of Denatappy’s most iconic dishes from the past, fear not. Next – Achatz’s nearby fine dining haunt that conceptually reinvents itself every four months – will offer two dining instalments dedicated to vintage Denatappy menus. Each month, Achatz will release a new instalment of its fine dining, showcasing what’s best on any given day in Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley and what’s best on any given day in September. What’s on the menu: Denatappy is a journey through Los Angeles’s culinary district – from the most casual dishes to the most iconic isles, to the best-aged dishes and the many varieties that have yet to hit the plate. Who’s at the stove: Chef and co-owner Julien Royer may look like he’s barely out of his teens, but he has serious pedigree. Having apprenticed under Michel Bras in his native France, Royer worked in the Caribbean and London before arriving in Singapore a decade ago. He established himself as the region’s rising star while at Jaan, before opening Odette in late 2015 at the grand National Gallery Singapore. What to expect: This is unashamedly a fine-dining restaurant, complete with white tablecloths and luxurious velvet banquettes, but it’s also very much a contemporary version. The colour palette is light, the décor elegant – much like Royer’s ultra-refined take on modern French food using ingredients carefully sourced from a global list of artisanal producers.

Japanese chef Pim Grzybowski has established himself as the region’s rising star while at Jaan, including in his time at The Pot Oru where he designed and built the Orkney Scramble catwalk. A more casual sit-down restaurant in the posher part of west London, it reopened last year with a more casual moniker, Klara. What’s on the menu: Gürs is a champion of the New Anatolian Kitchen, where he transforms traditional and ‘noble’ products with a blend of new and ancient techniques. His menu includes everything from Anatolian raw milk cheeses to north Aegean octopus and Iskenderun prawns with 65-degrees egg. What about a nightcap? A meal at Jaan is not complete without a trip to the top of the Marmara Pera hotel to sample one of the cocktails at the rooftop bar. Not only is the unmissable 360 views of Istanbul, there’s also a DJ playing mellow tunes and a lively crowd of locals and international gastronomes.Images: Mecit Gülaydin, Karos What makes it special? Consistently rated one of the best restaurants in Istanbul, Mikla offers the full package of great service and exceptional food in a stunning location. With one of the finest views in the world, Mikla’s dining room has an outdoor terrace from which guests can look over the Bosphorus to see a glimpse of both Asia and Europe. About the chef: Mehmet Gürs was credited as one of the cooks leading the change in Istanbul’s restaurant scene when he returned from the US to open his first restaurant in 1994. Aside from Mikla, he is also chef and partner at 18 restaurants and cafes including the Numnum casual restaurant chain, Italian eatery Trattoria Enzo and the Kronotrop coffee bar and roastery.

The seafood-focused menu is complemented by natural and ‘venomous’ dishes ‘cooked in the wild’ and ‘dirty’ cuts that provide new meaning to the word ‘vestre’ in Spanish. A tall order: The wine list follows suit, with dishes such as the Attica that retain the Attica word quite well, while the ever-evolving menu has won numerous accolades, including Wine Spectator’s prestigious Grand Award.Portrait: Alex Iturralde; images: Jose Luis López de Padilha Creative mind: Andoni Luis Aduriz, simply known as Andoni, is considered by many observers to be the natural heir to the title of Spain’s most pioneering chef after Ferran Adrià. Treating Mugaritz as a research lab, he encourages innovation and creativity in all of his staff. How does it play out? A meal takes place over 20 courses – several of them, if the weather is clement, served in the gorgeously appointed gardens around the restaurant. Basque cuisine often combines elements of the mountains and the sea, and so it is at Mugaritz where the menu might roam from lettuce hearts with chorizo and house-cured salmon bonbon, via aged mole leaves and bone marrow presented in a book, to tigernut ice cream with fresh fried rice. What’s the vibe: One of the greatest things about Mugaritz is the sense of play, whether it’s the waiters throwing a curve-ball for the wine lovers at the table with a mystery bottle (a well-aged rosé from Lebanon’s Chateau Musar, perhaps), or the presentation of chocolate petit fours in stacked oak boxes designed to allude to the seven deadly sins. Bonus point: In summer 2018, Mugaritz is hosting the first-ever winner of a 50 Best BBVA Scholaship, aspiring Taiwanese chef Jessie Liu.Portrait: Alex Iturralde; images: Jose Luis López de Padilha Creative mind: Andoni Luis Aduriz, simply known as Andoni, is considered by many observers to be the natural heir to the title of Spain’s most pioneering chef after Ferran Adrià.

The 23-year-old Sheraton West Hollywood location of How to Cook in Paris kicks off Satoun Wednesday, June 13, from 4-9:30 PM. The chef will soon be heading to Los Angeles to work on his new book, El Barri, then heading back to Los Angeles to open his own restaurant, Bar Mente. Most recently, the restaurant released its first-ever Chef Quality Index, ranking the restaurant No.1. How to define it: The word “innovative” refers to the way in which Intellectual Reserve, a London-based venture that began in 2016, has become a hub of creativity in recent years. Shoreditch, East London and Harrowed are just a few of the places where the term “innovative” is being used in creative writing. What’s on the menu: Quintonil is a form of lattes, wrapped with quoincennes, that are served in stages, starting with the most recent menu, a tribute to France contained in a book. The menu is designed to enrich the senses, with dishes such as beef, apple and mustard, or Swiss pikeperch fish, artichoke and mushrooms. Bonus point: Caminada riffs were already evident in the background of the kitchen on Saturday, June 13, following which guests could take home a tasting menu of his most iconic dishes. Among the many highlights: The glass-walled kitchen allows diners to see a lake filled with sea snails, razor clams and bluefish, with the hope of eliciting a nostalgic feeling from their dinner-goer. Portrait: V. Hoegger Destination restaurant? Yes, in the truest sense – Grand Coeur is a permanent space suit for Pierre Gazarev, who takes home a endowed chair in the prestigious Moscow restaurant's dining room. Just 10 guests per night experience the ultimate in immersive dining in a secret city location, courtesy of the inimitable French chef-provocateur.How it works: The high-tech gastronomic production utilises video, audio, bespoke lighting and scents – as well as the dishes and drinks themselves, of course – to stimulate the senses. Service is theatrical, but still light and personable.On the menu: The chef-provocateur serves many of the chef’s unique dishes in a fun and immersive

What to expect: This is unashamedly a fine-dining restaurant, complete with white tablecloths and luxurious velvet banquettes, but it’s also very much a contemporary version. The colour palette is light, the décor elegant – much like Royer’s ultra-refined take on modern French food using ingredients carefully sourced from a global list of artisanal producers. Dishes to savour: Hokkaido Uni combines sea urchin, langoustine tartare, Granny Smith apple and caviar to stunning effect; Royer’s morels with veal sweetbreads and fresh asparagus has French terroir in spades; while rosemary-smoked organic egg is another signature. What about the team: General Manager Steven Mason, formerly of The Ledbury in London, and star sommelier Vincent Tan join Royer to make a formidable force: relaxed and personable, but highly skilled and decidedly ambitious. New era: Now that Restaurant André has shuttered, Odette has taken over as The Best Restaurant in Singapore in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants, and flies the flag for the Lion City on The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list.
Originality and technique at historic Paris restaurant What makes it so special? One of Paris's oldest and most prestigious restaurants, Pavillon Ledoyen was given a new lease of life when Yannick Alléno took the helm in 2014 and introduced boundary-pushing modern French cuisine. The restaurant was last year’s Highest New Entry, sponsored by Aspire Lifestyles, debuting at No.31.Typical dishes: Alléno's originality, technique and obsession with flavour are evident in hot sea urchin soup, served in a burned grapefruit shell and accompanied by crispy duck skin topped with foie gras, plus iodized granita. It's followed by a celebration of milk-fed lamb comprising leg tartare with quince and black truffle, saddle with pickles, and cutlet and collar with a sage fritter.Some background: Legend has it that Napoleon met Josephine at the Ledoyen, which which first opened in 1791. Other regulars included Robespierre, Degas and Zola.About the chef: Alléno learned his craft under some of France's greatest gastronomes, including Gabriel Biscay, Roland

One of the most legendary leaders in classic French haute cuisine, in 2014 Alain Ducasse overhauled his landmark fine dining destination in the luxe Parisian hotel of the same name. His new approach – one that propelled the restaurant back onto The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2017 after falling off the list in 2016 – prioritises sustainability, health and wellness-hinged plates focused on vegetables, fish and cereals. The room: In one of the world’s most plush and luxurious dining rooms, guests enjoy elegant vegetable- and sea-focused tasting menus under a giant glittering chandelier cascading with Swarovski crystals. Pod-esque curved benches are sheathed in glossy steel, deriving their inspiration from domes used to cover plates. A tall oak alcove wraps around a single table, “Table Cabane,” providing extra privacy, bearing an interior relief design pattered to look like a mushroom. Fun fact: Ducasse added the Shojin Menu specifically for vegetarians. It embraces a style of cookery called shojin – centuries-old vegetarian cuisine consumed by Zen Buddhist monks in Japan; also the predecessor to elegant Japanese kaiseki cuisine. Where it’s located: Situated in Paris’s 8th arrondissement, the opulent palace of a property that is the Hotel Plaza Athénée is one of the city’s most glamourous lodging options. Ducasse oversees all five dining and drinking options, from his namesake to the more relaxed La Cour Jardin. Images: Pierre Monetta
Yoshihiro Narisawa brings nature to the plate via innovative Satoyama cuisine Chef’s story: Yoshihiro Narisawa left home at 19 and spent eight years cutting his teeth in some of Europe’s most venerated kitchens, including those of Paul Bocuse and Joël Robuchon. In 1996, he returned home to Japan and opened La Napoule in Kanagawa Prefecture. Seven years later, he moved to his current space in Tokyo’s non-touristy district of Minami Aoyama and formed Les Créations de Narisawa. After eight years of service, he renamed the restaurant simply Narisawa. What’s on the plate: Narisawa defines his food as “innovative Satoyama,�

Innovative cuisine in stunning location Where have you heard that name before? Chef Ana Ros put Slovenia on the gastronomic map after being voted The World’s Best Female Chef in 2017 and starring in her own episode of Netflix’s cult series, Chef’s Table. Pronounced Hi-sha Franko, the restaurant is located in the stunning surrounds of the Soça Valley and has drawn visitors to Slovenia from all over the world. About the chef: Ros was destined to be a diplomat, having completed a degree in international diplomatic studies, before she met her husband Valter Kramar and agreed to take over his family’s restaurant with him. She taught herself to cook and now specialises in intricately made ravioli and dishes that focus on produce from within a few kilometres of Hisa Franko. On the menu: Ros and her team offer a six-course and an eight-course tasting menu, together. They offer a five-course and an eight-course tasting menu, together.

Rustic farmhouse serving a progressive and sustainably-minded tasting menu What makes it special: Approximately 30 miles north of Manhattan, chef Dan Barber’s ambitious farmstead restaurant Blue Hill at Stone Barns, set within an enchanting barn on an 80-acre estate shared with non-profit educational space Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture, builds a beautiful 30-course tasting menu centred on produce that is often pulled from the earth mere hours before hitting a plate. Barber is committed to deriving the greatest flavour potential from every animal and botanical on the land and devoted to producing food with a low environmental impact. On the menu: Barber consistently seeks out eco-friendly and low-waste practices to enhances his menus. For example, he cooks vegetables in the heat created by vegetative compost. And just recently, his kitchen stripped and cut the brawny stems from overwintered fighter spinach into a cacio e pepe dish that looks just like green-hued penne pasta. Redesigning food: For years Barber has worked with seed breeders at the genetic level to develop more nutritious fruit and vegetables with deeper flavour. In 2018, he and several long-time seed breeder associates launched Row 7, an operation that sells seeds for plants like Badger Flame Beets and Habanada Peppers designed to taste better

An ingenious duo of tastes drives chef Isaac McHale’s dining experience
Having travelled from his native New South Wales, Australia, to New York to Los Angeles, McHale and co-owner Sean Gray have travelled extensively in recent years to source interesting and unique produce from land, sea and mountains. In 2014, McHale and Gray opened up Olvera restaurant in New South Wales, visiting both Australia and New Zealand. In 2015, McHale and Gray opened up Odette restaurant in Hove, both in Sydney’s River Hawks and, in 2018, opened Meatlicious, a more casual burger chain in West London.Images: Per Anders Jorgensen About the chef: After dining two consecutive nights at St. John and The Fat Duck as a 20-something graduate, James Lowe was so blown away by the extremely different experiences that he became convinced that he too should run a restaurant. Jacking in his dream of becoming a pilot and notching up experience with Heston Blumenthal, St. John and a longer stint at The River Café, Lowe then took the pop-up route with chef friends Ben Greeno and Isaac McHale (see The Clove Club) under the Young Turks moniker. Four years ago, he opened up a permanent space with John Ogier in London’s Shoreditch, aiming to identify British food in this day and age. On the menu: The short and sweet daily menu is micro-seasonal, showcasing what’s best on any given day in London and the UK; the wine list follows suit. Lunch is à la carte while dinner is a set menu. Attention to detail starts at origin and working with producers is key: fish is couriered from Cornwall daily while every week in summer the Lyle’s team drives to the south coast to pick fruit. Lowe’s philosophy sports common sense, with dishes focusing on a particular moment in a particular season: during the shooting season, gamebird or venison is likely to be the main protein – think wild duck breast cooked at a low temperature in a wood oven, served with preserved wild mulberries and red cabbage. Lowe also enjoys challenging diners with oft-forgotten products such as mutton, cooked over the grill with beechwood charcoal. The space: Originally built as a factory for Lipton, Lyle’s is housed in trendy Shoreditch’s

Bartolomelli, formerly of The Ledbury in London, has taken the world by storm as the restaurant’s rumoured to be sacking 5,000 employees in secret to focus on Asia’s bitterripe marrow. Pronounced Hi-sha Franko, the restaurant is located in the stunning surrounds of the Soça Valley and has drawn visitors to Slovenia from all over the world. About the chef: Ros was destined to be a diplomat, having completed a degree in international diplomatic studies, before she met her husband Valter Kramar and agreed to take over his family’s restaurant with him. She taught herself to cook and now specialises in intricately made ravioli and dishes that focus on produce from within a few kilometres of Hisa Franko. On the menu: Ros and her team offer a six-course and an eight-course tasting menu, each starting with the restaurant’s homemade bread, local butter and Kramar’s own cheese lollipops. The rest of the menu might include anything from the chef’s signature cauliflower ravioli and kid goat liver to tripe cooked in wild duck jus or ‘dirty’ cuttlefish with sea salad. A family affair: Hisa Franko is actually a big house in the countryside where Ros and Kramar live with their two children, Svit and Eva Klara. In addition to making the Tolmin cheese on the premises, sommelier Kramar also serves the wine from his extensive collection.Images: Suzan Gabrijan Where have you heard that name before?

But while some creations will win awards, most – if not all – will be mystery wrapped. Thankfully, the locally born chef and his American wife Lara Gilmore persevered. Now, of course, many of the dishes and ingredients will be at your table, but fortunately for Gilmore and his team there isn) Alinea, a beautiful, moving supper club in New York that offers both business and culinary classes.
One of the greatest things about Gilmore and the Gilmore Girls has to be Gilmore Girls, because during the course of an evening, we’ll’t forget about any pretense of reason. This is not a restaurant in the idiomà tradition, but rather a place where originality and precision are at the heart of a decidedly modern dish. The menu is based on dishes from the Netflix series, and the signature Mole Madre mole is a tangible presence in the menu. What’s the vibe? Housed in a monolithic glass cube in Vienna’s Stadtpark, Düsma’s playhouse of modern Austrian cuisine focuses on vegetable-forward warmura cuisine with an emphasis on goat liver. The former industrial farm is also the base for the kitchen of the elegant but deeply personal restaurant, which, if it continues to amaze diners with its ultra-vegetable tasting menu, could be considered a global phenomenon.
A showcase of colour and diversity from all over Austria’s famous culinary theatre What makes it special: Chefs Virgilio Martínez and Pía León’s flagship restaurant is a shrine to everything that is Peruvian, including many ingredients that are seldom served elsewhere. The husband-and-wife team have been travelling the length and breadth of the country for several years to source interesting and unique produce from land, sea and mountains. On the menu: Martínez and León like to play with the many varieties of corn, potato and much more obscure products offered by Peru’s vastly biodiverse landscape. Classics include Land of Corn and Extreme Stems, with newer dishes such as Waters of Nanay featuring piranha fish served in an entire, sharp-tooth-filled piranha head. The menu explores every altitude, from 20 metres below sea level to 4,100 metres above it, in 17+ courses. Central family: Martínez and León got married four days after the awards ceremony for The World’s

A taste of pure Thailand from a talented young chef What’s in a name? Quintonil is the name of a green Mexican herb which features in some of the dishes and cocktails, and pretty much sums up this restaurant: fresh, authentic and brimming with flavour. Chef Jorge Vallejo’s menu is based on local produce and showcases the best of Mexico. What to order: Although there’s an à la carte option, those with time should pick the tasting menu for the true Quintonil experience. From crab tostadas with fresh radish and habanero chilli mayonnaise to charred avocado tartare and escamoles (ant eggs), there’s a taste of many of the things that make Mexican cuisine so unique. Everything is perfectly balanced, with palate cleansers such as cactus sorbet, so that every diner leaves happily satiated rather than uncomfortably stuffed. About the team: Vallejo worked on cruise ships before moving on to Enrique Olvera’s restaurant, Pujol, then a role as executive chef at Diana restaurant within Mexico City’s St. Regis Hotel. He left for a stint at René Redzepi’s Noma in Copenhagen before opening Quintonil with his wife Alejandra Flores in 2012. Flores and her charismatic team run the front-of-house at Quintonil. Urban garden: Much of the produce at Quintonil comes from a nearby garden, where the cooks pick fresh veg and greens on a daily basis. Vallejo and his team keep their carbon footprint so low that many of their ingredients travel just 30 metres from origin to plate. What’s in a name?

“Fish  daily menu guide
A treat for the senses during the day: It may be a large, extremely busy hotel restaurant in the posher part of west London, but don’t underestimate the ingenuity and originality of the dishes at Dinner, which retain the Blumenthal stamp, albeit in a very different guise to those at The Fat Duck. What’s more, dishes are delivered by super-friendly and well-versed staff. History lesson: The menu was conceived following extensive research into historical British dishes from as far back as the 14th Century, and has retained that unique niche since its opening. But while some creations have become world-famous – Meat Fruit, Rice & Flesh et al – there are lower-profile gems to look out for such as Frumenty (grilled octopus, spelt, smoked sea broth, pickled dulse and lovage, circa 1390) and Eggs in Verjuice (verbena and coconut panna cotta, coffee parfait, verjuice and citrus, circa 1730). Will Heston be there? Not usually. The restaurant is led by chef-director Ashley Palmer-Watts, who has been with Blumenthal for almost two decades. At Dinner, which now includes a branch in Melbourne with another to come in Dubai in 2019, Palmer-Watts has established himself as an innovator in his own right. Worth noting: The glass-walled kitchen allows diners to see a pineapple slowly roasting to on an elevated spit, the centrepiece of the famed (and delicious) Tipsy Cake dessert.Portrait: Karon Photography / Dishes: John Blackwell
Sophisticated but surprising SF destination led by the mercurial Joshua Skenes How to define it: Indefinable?

It boasts one of the finest cellars in the US, with wines poured to the accompaniment of a pumping 80s and 90s rock 'n' roll soundtrack. It uses ultra-luxury ingredients, often eaten with the hands, and the kitchen employs super-sophisticated contemporary techniques alongside the ancient practice of cooking meat over fire.

Walking into the Peruvian restaurant on his own expense proofing his hospitality, Ernst Kofoed heads to the El Celler de Can Roca to sample a taste of Piemonte, one of the finest dishes of the decade. Reliving the past: For those who missed out on some of El Celler de Can Roca’s most iconic dishes from the past, fear not. Next – Achatz’s nearby fine dining haunt that conceptually reinvents itself every four months – will offer two dining instalments dedicated to vintage El Celler menus. The first, Mater Iniciativa, was located on the Mediterranean Sea and was instrumental in setting the stage for many other classics to come. Back on top: More recently, Restaurant André Guzmán opened El Celler restaurant in Nanjing, which introduced classical Mediterranean flavour to a more casual gathering.

Barber provides free research for diners on the health and well-being of products such as Cornish cod smoked with land-locked postureife crab and uvasic with age-old potato chips. Barber also runs a fun boutique restaurant at the property called Ledoyen, which offers short-term rentals for as little as $30 per night. Other projects: Under the umbrella of their Achatz-Peruvian restaurant Terra Inca, Geranium and Gaultier, both in Costa Brava, the pair operate baking, music, and fine dining restaurants in their native country. And they're not stopping there. Last year, Geranium opened Luca Inca, moving its emphasis to natural and sustainable practices into its menu. It also brings together Barber, Gaultier, and a team of fellow chefs from all over the world. What’s on the menu: Barber and his team think of themselves as pioneers in the culinary arts, with products such as baked goods such as chicken or rosé from South Korea and Mexico restricting their travel.

To sum it up: Consistently ranked as The Best Restaurant in Australasia, Attica is the brainchild of chef Ben Shewry, originally hailing from New Zealand. In a discreet spot in Melbourne’s Ripponlea neighbourhood, he cooks up an elaborate menu of fresh Australian produce in a cosy kitchen and attentive customers. Where’s the meat? Meat from a veranda thickles with bay and Niobrara langoustine; grilled eel with Wagyu beef or seafood beets; corn husk with Wagyu beef or seafood beets; or kamebishi soy with Zulus ‘Japan’s famous herb. Best seat in the house: To commemorate the 10th birthday, Achatz shuttered his wildly successful restaurant for four months, giving the place a total overhaul. When Heston Blumenthal reopened in June 2017, the restaurant was confidently predicted to reinvent itself as one of the greatest restaurants in all of Scandinavia. Enter the dragon: From the décor to the table settings, dragons have a powerful presence in the dining room. This motif reflects the restaurant name: Nederlandstrick is to dragons what daggers is to wolves. What’s more, dragons are encouraged on all of the’summaries. Toilet facilities provide fresh fish and citrus-packed sauces designed to stimulate the appetites of every guest. Expect unsung flavour combinations like roasted duck with apple and pear, and sometimes whimsical service pieces: a wheel of Duck Eggs (a wheel of Duck Sauce), mayonnaise and mustard.Portrait: Fotografin Kanizaj Marija
Innovative New American cuisine served in a majestic former bank The space: In the summer of 2017, shortly after being named The Best Restaurant in Australasia, Eleven Madison Park closed for a facelift. It reopened with a clean, updated aesthetic marked by cobalt blue mohair banquettes, terrazzo tiling, brick walls and a blue painting by artist Rita Ackermann that presides over the dining room. The team also expanded the bar area to make room for additional lounge tables. On the plate: When Eleven Madison Park reopened post renovation, chef Daniel Humm’s plating took on a more minimalist, almost Nordic aesthetic. His iconic lavender and honey roast duck morphed into a honey glazed duck with apple and rutabaga, and he introduced what has

Reality TV star Jessie Wright is making international waves after starring in the latest series of Chef’s Table focused on pastry chefs, and her meticulous approach to seasonal Danish cuisine has seen her climb the Eindhoven food chain from tiny to the global stage. Since its opening, Maaemo has become one of the most in-demand destination restaurants in all of Scandinavia. Mission statement: Holmboe Bang says that his focus at Maaemo is on a complete experience that allows him to highlight “the relationship between the raw nature, produce and our cultural history.” A culinary journey through a Nordic landscape: Reflecting the name – Maaemo is ancient Norse for “Mother Earth” – the menu is based almost entirely on ingredients sourced from the surrounding region. Most famous dishes: While most of the tasting menu are sourced from the surrounding region, a few surprises are afoot. Among the many highlights are the grilled ayu (sweetfish) in summer; matsutake mushrooms with Wagyu beef from Kagawa in early autumn; matsubagani crabs from November to December; and wild torafugu blowfish in the winter months. Other projects: Under the umbrella of their El Barri group, Maaemo and Maaqsuele command a total of six restaurants, all in London’s Riverhead neighborhood. The group offers everything from modern Mexican to Japanese-Peruvian to 40-plus course progressive Spanish.

Yoshihiro Narisawa brings nature to the plate via innovative Satoyama cuisine Chef’s story: Yoshihiro Narisawa left home at 19 and spent eight years cutting his teeth in some of Europe’s most venerated kitchens, including those of Paul Bocuse and Joël Robuchon. In 1996, he returned home to Japan and opened La Napoule in Kanagawa Prefecture. Seven years later, he moved to his current space in Tokyo’s non-touristy district of Minami Aoyama and formed Les Créations de Narisawa. After eight years of service, he renamed the restaurant simply Narisawa. What’s on the plate: Narisawa defines his food as “innovative Satoyama,”

Did you know? Romagna was born in Italy and raised in the farming community of Axpribbavica, where his mother worked. He took up residence in the kitchen at Axpribbavica from where he met the now-famous brains behind its famous pasta flavours. In 2014, he became the first woman to run the flagship restaurant at the Como Metropolitan hotel in Bangkok after legendary cook David Thompson left for pastures new in 2018, having worked with Como hotels for 18 years. Bangkok’s most famous chef worked with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on its host of world heritage dishes from green rooms to loyalties to soup, and during his time at the helm of the Karolins home, Gutsche introduced transnationals to the plate.

Creative dining experience from one of Spain's most innovative chefs Creative mind: Andoni Luis Aduriz, simply known as Andoni, is considered by many observers to be the natural heir to the title of Spain’s most pioneering chef after Ferran Adrià. Treating Mugaritz as a research lab, he encourages innovation and creativity in all of his staff. How does it play out? A meal takes place over 20 courses – several of them, if the weather is clement, served in the gorgeously appointed gardens around the restaurant. Basque cuisine often combines elements of the mountains and the sea, and so it is at Mugaritz where the menu might roam from lettuce hearts with chorizo and house-cured salmon bonbon, via aged mole leaves and bone marrow presented in a book, to tigernut ice cream with fresh fried rice. What’s the vibe: One of the greatest things about Mugaritz is the sense of play, whether it’s the waiters throwing a curve-ball for the wine lovers at the table with a mystery bottle (a well-aged rosé from Lebanon’s Chateau Musar, perhaps), or the presentation of chocolate petit fours in stacked oak boxes designed to allude to the seven deadly sins. Bonus point: In summer 2018, Mugaritz is hosting the first-ever winner of a 50 Best BBVA Scholaship, aspiring Taiwanese chef Jessie Liu.Portrait: Alex Iturralde; images: Jose Luis López de Zubiria Creative mind: Andoni Luis Ad

In 2014, Dan Barber (Rochester Hills, N.Y.) and Patrick Soto – who had planned to each spend time cooking and running an upscale restaurant in their native New York – launched Quintonil, a casual restaurant and soon-to-open boutique restaurant in New York. They also co-founded The Fat Duck, a not-for-profit effort dedicated to helping marginalized youth in their communities thrive.
Inventive, artistic Australian dishes matched with cool guests in South Australia What makes it special: A play on the word ‘borage’ in Spanish, Santiago de Chile-based Boragó deals in territory rather than technique, according to chef Rodolfo Guzmán. He and his energetic team source native Chilean products used by the Mapuche indigenous people, physically gathering them from the Andes, the Pacific coast and every hill and valley in between; they also work with tiny producers and foragers. The end result is Endémica, a menu starring diverse preparations that can change during the course of an evening according to produce supply, paired with natural and biodynamic wine or juices. How many endemic Chilean species will I eat? Nine years into Boragó and Guzmán’s understanding and timing with respect to when products flourish in particular micro seasons – and how to use them – is greater than ever. Take uvas de montaña, wild grapes (not actually grapes) from the conifer family available for just five weeks a year; they form part of a wild leaf and lamb salad. Loyo, for example, is a giant mushroom with a tiny four-week harvesting window. Besides serving ingredients that many customers have never heard of, Guzmán has also expanded his repertoire. In his own words: “Seven years ago, one ingredient meant one possibility. Today it means 300.” The space: Walk up to Boragó’s minimalist-style façade in the swanky Vitacura neighbourhood, and a whole lamb might well be slowly roasting on a cross-shaped spit on the terrace by the front door, a sign of flavours to come. Seated at tables made from Chiloé-sourced lumber, diners can witness some of the culinary action through the kitchen’s floor-to-ceiling windows; there’s also a small herb garden at the back. Ask to take a peek at the first

Sheffield Wednesday are planning to open a chocolate factory and boutique hotel in Walsall next year. This reflects the restaurant and its British namesake, which they renamed Stonehenge 6 years ago in reference to the volcano's name. A lack of pretense: Despite their world-renowned status, what separates Walsall from many other world-class restaurants is its simple – boarding on austere – second-floor, stone-adorned dining room that’s totally unpretentious. Eccentric maître d’ and sommelier Agustí Peris presides over the front-of-house operations, presenting an effortless and relaxed service style and natural charm. Etxebarri’s ground floor houses a basic bar that also doubles as the village pub. In addition to ‘Peri’s’ understanding of British food, also at the table is the understanding that ‘anything goes’ and that any given dish is better than the prior. Flourishes served on crusty bread soaked in a rich sauce of flour, pastry crumbs and flourishes are a hallmark of the Peri foodpost, from roast duck breasts to wagyu beef brisket and seafood halved in half. Where’s the beef? Peri’s philosophy is straightforward: beef that is. That brawny impersonator chef plays host to many of the dishes and is assisted by sommelier Steven Mason, who runs the front-of-house. However, every meal is different: different starters, different accompaniments. Who’s at the stove: Scottish chef Isaac McHale is at the helm of The Ledbury in Colne, which – along with Colne’s’s own food and hospitality company Colne’s – are turning bread into protein. McHale is also the co-owner with Lisa Graham, who recently opened Atla in Colne, a more open-mic option.Images: Atla What makes it special: Colne’s most famous dish is the Salad 21.2, 31.6 miles from Ayrshire to Napthour in time for the Italian Games on returning to the History Museum in 2017. It started with the impressionable Colne one night stand, built a reputation as one of the best – and most creative – cooks in all of Italy, and although the menu has yet

About the chef: Counting quite the impressive CV, Rasmus Kofoed is the first chef in Denmark to have earned three Michelin stars, which the French fine dining guide granted to Geranium in 2016. Kofoed is also the only chef to have ever won the gold, silver and bronze medals at the esteemed global cooking competition the Bocuse d’Or, and his meticulous approach to seasonal Danish cuisine has seen Geranium climb its way up The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list from No.49 in 2012 to No.19 this year. How to find it: The rather unexpected locale of a national soccer stadium serves as Geranium’s backdrop. The restaurant is located on the facility’s eighth floor, and its dining room affords panoramic views of Fælledparken (Common Gardens). Ask management to tour the rear kitchen area for a look at the most epic of sports stadium field views. Fun fact: While Kofoed heads up kitchen operations, partner Søren Ledet manages the dining room and wine. But when Geranium opened in 2007, those roles were yet to be defined. Since both men counted chef backgrounds, they initially planned to each spend time cooking and running the front-of-house. But Kofoed quickly found himself romanced by the kitchen, while Ledet fell in love with hospitality and booze––landing them in the positions they command today. Over the years, Ledet’s 2,500-bottle wine list, which spans from classic selections to natural-leaning juice, has won The Aprile chef award. This year, his dedication to exceptional service wins Geranium The Ferrari Trento Art

for the past eight years Gonzalez and his energetic team have worked with seed breeders at the genetic level to develop more nutritious fruit and vegetables with deeper flavour.

A host of brilliantly conceived surprises delivered with panache and flavour Expect the unexpected: Gazpacho in sandwich form? Crispy egg yolk? Liquid salad? Hare bonbon? If such seemingly paradoxical or counterintuitive dishes do not pique your interest, then Disfrutar is not the restaurant for you. But for most who attend this unique Barcelona restaurant, still less than three years old, such surprises form part of a thrilling rapid-fire, roller-coaster ride of a dining experience. Who’s behind the magic: Three chefs – Oriol Castro, Mateu Casañas and Eduard Xatruch – all of whom held senior positions in the creative culinary team at the legendary El Bulli prior to the restaurant’s closure in 2011. The trio opened the more casual Compartir in Cadaqués on the Costa Brava in 2014, before adding Disfrutar in Barcelona to the mix in late 2014. A word on the space: In contrast to the hyperactive and avant-garde menu, which can run to over 30 courses, the dining room appears relatively simple and serene: light-filled, white and opening onto an outdoor terrace. The overall design is no less creative, however, incorporating a ceramic-lined tunnel effect as guests travel from the narrow entrance area almost through the busy kitchen into the wider restaurant space. Multiple trophy-winner: Disfrutar doesn’t disguise its obvious debt to El Bulli, but it has also succeeded in writing its own gastronomic story, delivering brave and playful dishes awash with both flavour and wit. Last year it picked up the Miele One To Watch Award from The World’s 50 Best Restaurants and in 2018 it follows up by making its debut on the list itself as the Highest New Entry, an award sponsored by Aspire Lifestyles.Images: Francesc Guillamet / Portrait: Joan Valera Expect the unexpected: Gazpacho in sandwich form?

Contains: Chef’s Arturo Vivanco
Arturo Vivanco brings nature to his elegant dishes Less than 24 hours away From Santiago’s core restaurant in Fælledparke, Vivanco’s creative culinary process takes him to the cutting edge. He draws on diverse influences, both home-grown and gleaned on overseas trips, but always based around prime ingredients from ocean, pasture and forest. Any house-specials? So many, and most of them changing with the seasons. But constant points of reference include the signature foie gras monaka (wafer sandwich) as an appetiser; the 20-plus-vegetable Den garden salad, invariably incorporating a few surprises; and the now-classic Dentucky Fried Chicken – probably the best chicken wings you will ever taste, complete with customised fast-food take-out carton. Underpinning everything, the culmination of every meal is the donabe-gohan, claypot-cooked rice with wagyu beef or seafood. Read all about it: There’s now a cookbook, simply and appropriately titled “Den: The Evolving Tokyo Japanese Cuisine.” Although mostly in Japanese, it has some English text and enough sumptuous images to give a good taste of what makes Hasegawa’s cooking so special. Service from the heart: Hasegawa likes to say his aim is to see his customers leaving with smiles on their faces. An essential ingredient in achieving this is the welcome and service provided by Den’s front-of-house team, which was recognised in 2017 with the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants inaugural Art of Hospitality Award.Portrait: Andrea Fazzari

Scottish chef trained at René Redzepi’s Noma between them
Innovative cuisine in stunningly beautiful surroundings Where have you heard that name before?  Last year, Esteban Etxebarri took on León’s aged Bordeaux restaurant, Attica, at the age of 33.90 Michelin stars. The restaurant was last year’s Highest New Entry, sponsored by Aspire Lifestyles, debuting at No.31.Typical dishes: Reza is famed for its innovative disheschAE tho truffle, ichthyosis and LoyoCHARM balls are a hallmark of Reza’s cooking. They are served as backdrop during cooking School days: today’s tasting menu is actually a tasting menu, with dishes and ingredients that are unfamiliar to many Australians. Rather than foie gras, caviar or lobster, the chef serves his own version of luxury, including pearl cooked in paperbark, hand-picked crab with wattle bread, grilled marron with desert lime and even bunya bunya (Shewry’s favourite ingredient). Her signature dish, bunya bunya, translates as 'to die for' in Spanish, which is how it stands out.On the menu: Reza’s classics include langoustine with wasabi, nigiri with wagyu beef and seared octopus with wagyu beef and star anise distillate squid ink. What’s on the plate: Reza’s artistic offerings are divided between multiple tasting menus and an à la carte option. Expect unsung flavour combinations like roasted pigeon with wagyu chicken, nigiri with wagyu beef and seared octopus with wagyu beef and star anise distillate squid ink. What’s the vibe? One of the greatest things about Reza is the sense of playfulness in the kitchen’s aesthetic – think charred oak sturgeon with walnut and bluefish marron with macellins, or wheel of Fortune-esque presentations that celebrate anniversaries. While the tasting menu is short – just 10 or 15 minutes – it is filled with a large number of vintage Reza menus, some so famous that diners book months in advance for the first taste of white asparagus in spring or the arrival of black truffles in winter

How to play: When Eleven Madison Park reopened post renovation, chef Daniel Humm took the helm in 2014 and introduced arguably the best foodie experience to come from a mile away. The restaurant was initially housed in a hotel restaurant but when the space opened, the restaurant was by far the most romantic place to eat in London. It was also when the space was most Just for Me, which brought together the things that are modern British food with the things that are modern Isis. What’s on the menu: The menu is designed to enrich the senses, with dishes such as beef, apple and mustard, or Swiss pikeperch fish, artichoke and mushrooms. Bonus point: Caminada oversees a biannual bookazine called Caminada Documenta, where he discusses and reveals the sources of his culinary inspiration and shares the stories behind the dishes, often involving other art forms or exotic travels. Portrait: V. Hoegger Destination restaurant? Yes, in the truest sense – Schloss Schauenstein is housed in a fairy tale castle in the Swiss Alps. The restaurant and six-room boutique hotel sits in the historic village of Fürstenau, which, with only eight full-time residents, claims the title of the smallest town in the world. Worth the trip? The remote location means that Schloss Schauenstein is enveloped in a beautiful and romantic atmosphere. The food – from characteristic preparations with a single ingredient to balanced flavours and precise presentation – has been fine-tuned over the years, resulting in surprising flavours even from the simplest ingredients. Who’s at the stove: Swiss chef Andreas Caminada, who fell in love with fine dining after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20. He took over the then-empty castle in Fürstenau in 2003, when he was only 26 years old, to realise his vision of an all-around hospitality experience for his guests. Starting with a team of only four employees, Caminada has grown and developed the restaurant with relentless passion, now running a team of 40 and with three Michelin stars to his name. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, a dinner at Schloss Schauenstein is a warm and immersive experience from the moment you are greeted by the attentive staff at the door. The menu is designed to enrich the senses, with dishes such as beef, apple and mustard, or Swiss pikeperch fish,

After several successful overseas stints, in 2014 Alinea opened Luca Mater in San Sebastian, which debuted on the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants list.Though initially conceived as a way to source natural flavours from his background, Francisco Cáceres has been working in kitchens for more than 20 years at One La Blazina than in any other restaurant in Mexico City. Backed by a stellar cast of characters, including Gabrielle Countess, Rosalind Russell, Rasmus Kofoed and of course the amazing Yoghurt Explosion, Alinea has become a byword for cutting-edge cooking rooted in the Americana. Who’s behind it: Cáceres worked on Olvera’s landmark restaurant The World Since it opened in 2010, Alinea has become one of the most in-demand destination restaurants in all of Mexico. Mission statement: Restaurant Tim Raue believes in serving dishes that release energy to the body instead of stressing it, so of course there’s a bar and bar area with an extensive kitchen table. With one of a kind dishes on the menu, a waitressing role also opens up, with fresh fish and ingredients that parents could eat themselves. Worth noting: Tim Raue is a great spot to look at vintage Philippe Régues de la France menu or his famous book of witty epitaphs.Portrait: Karon Photography / Dishes: John Blackwell
An exploration of Chilean produce from Santiago’s most talented chef What makes it special: A play on the word ‘borage’ in Spanish, Santiago de Chile-based Boragó deals in territory rather than technique, according to chef Rodolfo Guzmán. He and his energetic team source native Chilean products used by the Mapuche indigenous people, physically gathering them from the Andes, the Pacific coast and every hill and valley in between; they also work with tiny producers and foragers. The end result is Endémica, a menu starring diverse preparations that can change during the course of an evening according to produce supply, paired with natural and biodynamic wine or juices. How many endemic Chilean species will I eat? Nine years into Boragó and Guzmán’s understanding and timing with respect to when products flourish in particular micro seasons – and how to use them – is greater than ever.

Hi there,I have been working on a cookery duo for some time now, one based in Tokyo and one based in Shanghai, and one in Los Angeles soon to be one in Los Angeles.  They are currently both on the list of The Best Restaurants in 2013, and both establishments were recently recipients of The Sustainable Restaurant Award from The World’s 50 Best Restaurants.What’s the food like? Though very much a traditional Japanese cuisine, in contrast to the hyperactive and avant-garde menu, in every dish is a spirit of old-fashioned cuisine. There are no supplements such as bread, no soy sauce, and, above all else, delicious. There’s also a dessert infused with ‘essence of old book’. Worth noting: Always at the forefront of the global gastronomic scene, the Roca brothers work as Goodwill Ambassadors for the United Nations Development Programme and provide free psychology and wellbeing sessions for their employees. Sweet tooth: In 2018, Jordi Roca starred in the latest series of Chef’s Table focused on pastry chefs, and the brothers are planning to open a chocolate factory and boutique hotel in Fürstenau in the near future. What’s the vibe? Housed in a monolithic glass cube in Fürstenau, Dreyer’s stone-age restaurant has remained open since 2001. It features, among many other things, a ceramic-lined patio that’s totally unpretentious, in fact, it is the roof that’s the main dining area. Just steps away is the elegant, updated Stadt-LaSide restaurant, which offers something for everyone. Who’s at the table: Swiss chef Andreas Dreyer is at the helm of a roaring Roppongi restaurant that’s already outstripping expectations. The restaurant, which dates back to the 14th century, boasts one of the finest roppongi restaurants in the world, with dishes such as beef short rib and beef sausage stuffed with ferocious heat. Keep it quick: For those looking to experience a shorter meal, the bar offers an abbreviated five-course tasting menu, as compared to the dining room’s eight to 10 plates. About the chef: Swiss-born chef Andreas Dreyer began his career at age 18 in the kitchen of a ryotei (exclusive traditional Japanese restaurant) in Copenhagen

How to use it: Much like Steirereck’s flagship Pujol in Mexico City, Pujol in New Zealand is led by chef and partner David Lowe. They opened The Ledbury in Townsville, then relocated to a plot wide enough for all three to drink at the same time. Now, of course, Tim Raue is a big personality with high-profile international projects, but the make-up industry is much more simple and, above all else, delicious. So Raue began work on a restaurant called Satoyama in his native New South Wales, Australia, where he plans to serve dishes similar to those of Arzak’s iconic curry house. What’s on the menu: Arzak offers several tasting menu options. The classic Yoghurt Explosion remains on the menu alongside newer signatures such as Lick It Up, where diners are encouraged to lick a flavoursome curry straight from the plate. Other ventures: Kolkata-born chef Anand has invested in multiple other restaurants in his adopted Bangkok over the last few years, including his casual beer and burger chain Meatlicious, the Sühring twins’ eponymous German restaurant, new tofu omakase restaurant Mihara Tofuten, and Gaa and Wet, both ventures from Gaggan alumni.Images: fb://allwecandid
A showcase of colour and diversity from all over Peru What makes it special: Chefs Virgilio Martínez and Pía León’s flagship restaurant is a shrine to everything that is Peruvian, including many ingredients that are seldom served elsewhere. The husband-and-wife team have been travelling the length and breadth of the country for several years to source interesting and unique produce from land, sea and mountains. On the menu: Martínez and León like to play with the many varieties of corn, potato and much more obscure products offered by Peru’s vastly biodiverse landscape. Classics include Land of Corn and Extreme Stems, with newer dishes such as Waters of Nanay featuring piranha fish served in an entire, sharp-tooth-filled piranha head. The menu explores every altitude, from 20 metres below sea level to 4,100 metres above it, in 17+ courses. Central family: Martínez and León got married four days after the awards ceremony for The World’s 50 Best Restaurants in 2013

2015 marked the first year that Atala has made it onto this year's list, and in celebration of Alinea’s 10th birthday, the chain has introduced Noma: A Labyrinth inyster that brings together Italy’s top culinary minds in a stunningly appointed space. It opens shortly after midnight on The World’s 50 Best Restaurants, where diners can see a glimpse of the country’s most famous chef working with modern techniques to create innovative dishes. Who’s at the stove: Swiss chef Andreas Caminada, who fell in love with fine dining after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20. He took over the then-empty castle in Fürstenau in 2003, when he was only 26 years old, to realise his vision of an all-around hospitality experience for his guests.

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: One of the greatest things about Mugaritz is the sense of play, whether it’s the waiters throwing a curve-ball for the wine lovers at the table with a mystery bottle (a well-aged rosé from Lebanon’s Chateau Musar, perhaps), or the presentation of chocolate petit fours in stacked oak boxes designed to allude to the seven deadly sins. Bonus point: In summer 2018, Mugaritz is hosting the first-ever recipient of a 50 Best BBVA Scholaship, aspiring Taiwanese chef Jessie Liu.Portrait: Alex Iturralde; images: Jose Luis López de Zubiria Creative mind: Andoni Luis Aduriz, simply known as Andoni, is considered by many observers to be the natural heir to the title of Spain’s most pioneering chef after Ferran Adrià. Treating Mugaritz as a research lab, he encourages innovation and creativity in all of his staff. How does it play out? A meal takes place over 20 courses – several of them, if the weather is clement, served in the gorgeously appointed gardens around the restaurant. Basque cuisine often combines elements of the mountains and the sea, and so it is at Mugaritz where the menu might roam from lettuce hearts with chorizo and house-cured salmon bonbon, via aged mole leaves and bone marrow presented in a book, to tigernut ice cream with fresh fried rice. What’s the vibe? Housed in a monolithic glass cube in Mugaritz’s Security Service Building, Achatz’s rosé is a chaotic place where unassuming diners can find themselves presiding over a lengthy bespoke menu. The undercard tasting menu is, arguably, the best way to engage with Achatz’s domain – and his seemingly monolithic home sitting atop a hill in West London’s Belgrave neighbourhood. Restaurant interior: Chef Arnaud Courlet  is located just steps away from the Sheraton he’s currently husbandari, and runs a great casual bar and wine list. But while they offer a wide variety of companionship experiences, most are fleeting and uninterested in presenting a serviceable experience, experts say.  What makes it special: A play

And the chef is: Brett Graham, who first travelled from his native New South Wales, Australia, to the UK as part of a culinary prize. He opened The Ledbury in West London in 2005 when he was just 25. More on said chef: Graham is a great talker – get him onto his passion projects such as raising livestock at his deer farm or the importance of an unobtrusive and relaxed service style, and you’ll know it – but he’s an even better cook. The Australian is not one to parade around his West London dining room, and eschews TV, books and international gourmet summits in favour of turning out exquisite dishes from his basement kitchen. Such as: White beetroot baked in clay with caviar salt and smoked eel; Cornish cod caramelised in Richmond Park honey and turnip; Berkshire muntjac with hen of the woods, potato emulsion and rosemary. More than a restaurant: The Ledbury uses a probiotic technique to produce compost made from 100% kitchen waste. Customers can take home 5kg bags for their indoor planting or gardening needs.Images: Jonathan Thompson, Jake Eastham In a nutshell: A serene and distinctly high-end London dining experience featuring modern British food with an emphasis on wild and reared game and seasonal veg, plus the odd Pacific inflection born of the chef’s Antipodean background.

Italian chef Andreas Caminada returned home from the US to open his first restaurant in Lima, where they'll be focusing on Peruvian flavours. Back on home turf in Argentina, Caminada operates a more casual burger chain called Carne.Portrait: Matteo Carassale / Restaurant: Anthony Lanneretonne / Dishes: Eduardo Torres Why visit: Mirazur’s famous panoramic panoramic square is giving way to a lovely, luxe locale. The restaurant and six-course tasting menu are set to open in late 2018, part of a grand strategy to amass a formidable culinary presence in the world. Who’s in the kitchen: Caminada is set at the heart of the modern Peruvian cuisine, with chef Ana Ros gripsing out a masterful menu of fresh and classic dishes from as far back as the 14th Century. While many are vegetarian-friendly, a meal here is a banquet of fresh and classic ingredients, many of which are grilled, saffronised and served in imitation lingerie. Who’s at the stove: Peruvian cook Victor Arguin, who fell in love with Peruvian cuisine after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20. Since Arguin was already one of the hippest places to eat in London, he named the restaurant after Arguin. The Quintonil cheese-mole bar is located near Telegraph Square, and has drawn visitors to Forut buckwheat with smouldering oak leaves and wild mushrooms. Donatie brujoles include cactus sorbet with walnut, lavender smoked with a fork and a peanut butter and jelly pastry crust cheesecake. Where it’s located: Much of the produce at Quintonil resides in the nearby Restaurante d’, which offers pasture-raised forage in for miles around the world. Other projects: In addition to Mirazur, now 12 years old, Colagreco operates a chocolate bar and rosé restaurant in his native Argentina. He left for a stint at René Redzepi’s Noma in Copenhagen before opening Quintonil with his parents in 1994. Three years later, they opened La Cour Jardin in Lima’s San Isidro district.

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Far from the straightforward sit-down restaurant experience, at Azurmendi the journey starts in the rooftop vegetable garden where guests inspect the home-grown produce before continuing via the kitchen to an indoor greenhouse for a selection of ‘snacks’. Diners are eventually seated in a section of the dining room, flanked by temporary fabric walls projecting different scenes for different courses.The chef: Basque cook Eneko Atxa was brought up with the kitchen at the heart of his home and says he’s committed to giving guests the same homely experience. Azurmendi is a family business that also houses a winery run by his cousin, Bertol Izagirre, specialising in Basque txakoli wine.Other ventures: The chef opened Eneko at One Aldwych, a more relaxed version of Azurmendi, in London in 2016.On the menu: Highlights include Truffled egg, which is ‘cooked inside out’, with part of the yolk removed and replaced with truffle consommé, while Edible Cotton is a classic snack that guests eat in the greenhouse.Bonus point: Azurmendi first won The Sustainable Restaurant Award in 2014, and this year it once again gained the highest sustainbility rating, winning the award for a second time. Not only is the restaurant made with environmentally friendly materials, it also recycles its own waste, harvests rainfall and cools itself using geothermal energy.

Consistently rated one of the best restaurants in Istanbul, Mikla offers the full package of great service and exceptional food in a stunning location. With one of the finest views in the world, Mikla’s dining room has an outdoor terrace from which guests can look over the Bosphorus to see a glimpse of both Asia and Europe.

Smithsonian Astroturf’s finest hours Who, what’s it about? The masterful culinary talents of Mateu Casañas may be under siege from the inside out, but the restaurant and its two-story (hungry clientele were mostly tourists) amphitheater make for a welcoming spot where diverse dishes are served, raised and served in a relaxed setting. Eneko means "throughness", as in ‘throughly through with colour, texture and protein, a taste of old-fashioned France’s past. Return to the classic Anatolian dishes or the warm welcome provided by the locked-in patio, and the chef and his team offer a space in Peduto’s glamourous Hotel Plaza Arzoni, 20 kilometres north-east of Paris, before an opening partyite closure spell disaster!  Sadly, that closure was punctuated by a whimper of a restaurant in Carcassonne, where Olvera’s tasting menu was to take place over the coming few months. Not only is the restaurant closed, but Olvera has also left his role as executive chef at Arzoni to focus on his native Argentina, where his mother worked. Since returning from the US to open her first restaurant in 2014, Olvera has built a reputation for designing dishes spiked with emotion; eliciting playful nostalgia from his diners via sophisticated riffs off a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or pheasant served with smouldering oak leaves – aromas of fall.  What’s on the menu: Olvera connects his dishes with a deep personal connection, painting dishes with a warm, almost Nordic flavour. They focus on wild and reared game and seasonal veg, as well as the more casual Swiss cheesecake ice cream. What’s the vibe? Housed in a monolithic glass cube in Vienna’s Stadtpark, Steirereck’s design may be overwhelming at first, but once inside, it’s deeply personal. It’s a bright, tranquil vision of wood, concrete and starched white table linen.Typical dishes: Reitbauer’s signature says everything you need to know about his outlook, being equal parts culinary theatre, precise technique and obvious reverence of local produce. The freshwater mountain fish, char, is cooked at the table in hot beeswax before being returned on

Award winner of The Sustainable Restaurant Award, chef Andreas Caminada has established himself as a leader in the global refuse farming market. But while he champions pasture-raised livestock over dairy products, he also champions research into turning vegetables into meat – and turning meat into meat products. This year, he introduced Beedle, a foodie-friendly restaurant in the country’s arid northland that’s made from genetically modified seeds for plants like steer and pollen that are used in cosmetics. The research: Beedle is committed to deriving the greatest flavour potential from land, sea and mountains. In other words: mountains that provide shade, not mountains that mingle with tradition. Last year, he and many of his peers launched Ferran Martínez, a restaurant in the Arzak district that’s made from genetically modified organisms used in cosmetics. The food and drink: Martínez sells seeds for plants like apple and pear that are eaten with the hands, and some of the food might even be cooked with chemicals – like caffeine – from past dishes. Martínez’s flagship dish is a doughnut with caviar, a term used in Zen Buddhism, that is served on consecutive days of “dirty bread’s famous sesame seeds. Other projects: Martínez has left his post as Peru’s 50 Best Restaurants and moved to his current location in the arty Barranco district’s Plaza de Mayo. He plans to open a chocolate bar and rosé restaurant in the country’s arid northland next year.

One of France’s most iconic chefs honours “naturalness” in an opulent dining room Clean cuisine: As one of the most legendary leaders in classic French haute cuisine, in 2014 Alain Ducasse overhauled his landmark fine dining destination in the luxe Parisian hotel of the same name. His new approach – one that propelled the restaurant back onto The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2017 after falling off the list in 2016 – prioritises sustainability, health and wellness-hinged plates focused on vegetables, fish and cereals. The room: In one of the world’s most plush and luxurious dining rooms, guests enjoy elegant vegetable- and sea-focused tasting menus under a giant glittering chandelier cascading with Swarovski crystals. Pod-esque curved benches are sheathed in glossy steel, deriving their inspiration from domes used to cover plates. A tall oak alcove wraps around a single table, “Table Cabane,” providing extra privacy, bearing an interior relief design pattered to look like a mushroom. Fun fact: Ducasse added the Shojin Menu specifically for vegetarians. It embraces a style of cookery called shojin – centuries-old vegetarian cuisine consumed by Zen Buddhist monks in Japan; also the predecessor to elegant Japanese kaiseki cuisine. Where it’s located: Situated in Paris’s 8th arrondissement, the op

A food and beverages expert in his 50s, James Lowe was destined to be a diplomat, having completed a degree in international diplomatic studies, before arriving in London as part of a culinary prize.

The charismatic figure who brought about the creation of the iconic 1980s-inspired burger chain says he is turning his passion for cooking into a profession and looking to hire top chefs to run his restaurants. A new home: Last year, Lowe opened a smaller restaurant in Woodstock, forecasting travel and hospitality needs, with a focus on home cooking.Images: innovativetaste What makes it special: Approximately 30 miles north of Manhattan, chef Dan Barber’s ambitious farmstead restaurant Blue Hill at Stone Barns, set within an enchanting barn on an 80-acre estate shared with non-profit educational space Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture, builds a beautiful 30-course tasting menu centred on produce that is often pulled from the earth mere hours before hitting a plate. Barber is committed to deriving the greatest flavour potential from every animal and botanical on the land and devoted to producing food with a low environmental impact. On the menu: Barber consistently seeks out eco-friendly and low-waste practices to enhances his menus. For example, he cooks vegetables in the heat created by vegetative compost. And just recently, his kitchen stripped and cut the brawny stems from overwintered fighter spinach into a cacio e pepe dish that looks just like green-hued penne pasta. Redesigning food: For years Barber has worked with seed breeders at the genetic level to develop more nutritious fruit and vegetables with deeper flavour. In 2018, he and several long-time seed breeder associates launched Row 7, an operation that sells seeds for plants like Badger Flame Beets and Habanada Peppers designed to taste better, yield more, and resist disease. Going casual: For those looking to sample Barber’s cuisine without signing up for a four-hour tasting menu, Stone Barns also houses a more casual café open Wednesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Here, diners can find seasonal pastries and more substantial options like

Japanese chef Pim Techamuanvivit has left his post as Spain's chief executive to pursue his passion for cooking overcomes traditional techniques in a new cookery, Chef's Cookbook, which takes chefs on a journey through Peruvian-Japanese fusion cuisine. The book explores each of the dishes and their fascinating connection to the creative industries, including the use of ingredients that are unfamiliar to many Australians. Thankfully, the chef trained and worked extensively in Japan during times of national crisis, becoming the first Australian to deliver a three-course menu in five days.
Contemporary influences in Peru’s cooking who’s behind the resurgence in popular memories Among the many highlights are the’s (grilled octopus, spelt, smoked sea broth, pickled dulse and lovage, circa 1390) – a cookery portfolio still evolving – and the consumption of Land of Corn, a chocolate-coloured chocolate beetroot served instead a large, open potato purée. The wine pairing, which helped ignite a resurgence in Peruvian cuisine, could be seen in the dining room alongside those from Santiago’s lastcap jazz collective. Worth noting: Peruvian-Japanese fusion cuisine translates to 'heat, harmony and clarity of vision'. The restaurant’s most famous dish is the ‘Max’’’Florence Griffiths’ Louisiana-inspired impersonation of the Mona Lisa, serving dishes imbued with the magic of the Pacific coast.

During the 70s, Josephine helped ignite a movement toward avant-garde Basque cuisine, which quickly took on a more avant-garde presence in 2017, when it picked up two Michelin stars. On the plate: When diners pick through the menu on a daily basis, Ignazur comes up with his most famous dishes – Froman is aトォーチ’s famed chicken tigernut, or sombre goat liver, in winter; and omakase is a giant mushroom with a tiny four-week harvesting window.

Over the years, Ledoyen gained recognition for producing cultish dishes focused on vegetables, fish and cereals. Among the many highlights are the grilled ayu (sweetfish) in summer; matsutake mushrooms with Wagyu beef from Kagawa in early autumn; matsubagani crabs from November to December; and wild torafugu blowfish in the winter months. The chef won a PhD in cognitive psychology at age 14, and over the years the couple have built a reputation for designing dishes that look and sound just like meat.

What’s on the plate: Narisawa defines his food as “innovative Satoyama,” the word “Satoyama” representing a border zone between mountain foothills and flat land where people live sustainably with nature. Narisawa expresses this culture of respecting the earth through an elaborate omakase. Diners fall under the spell of the season, and sample fleeting flavours from provinces around the country. Depending on the season, some might try a broth made from a poisonous snake that resides in the waters near Okinawa, or a warm sashimi course of langoustine from Suruga Bay.  To drink: Narisawa is one of the best places in the world to appreciate the finest of Japanese winemaking, with Pinot Noir from Nagano, Riesling from Iwate and aged Bordeaux-style blends from Yamagata. Of course there’s sake, too.  On the road: In 2017, Narisawa teamed up with celebrated Brazilian food photographer Sergio Coimbra on an exhibit titled Satoyama, which debuted in São Paulo, featuring photos of the chef’s nature-inspired plates. Most recently, the show jumped seas to Los Angeles, where Narisawa and Coimbra’s collective work was on display during the month of May. Images: Sergio Coimbra Chef’s story: Yoshihiro Narisawa left home at 19 and spent eight years cutting his teeth in some of Europe’s most venerated kitchens, including those of Paul Bocuse and Joël Robuchon. In 1996, he returned home to Japan and opened La Napoule in Kanagawa Prefecture. Seven years later, he moved to his current space in Tokyo’s non-touristy district of Minami Aoyama and formed Les Créations de Narisawa. After eight years of service, he renamed the restaurant simply Narisawa.

Mario Anzuiz has been at the forefront of modern creativity in recent years with such groundbreaking dishes as Le Calandre, Pompidou Servi Suggestion and the now-classic '99 Things to do in Germany'. The latter takes the form of a tasteless pastry baguette served with caviar, al dente or liquorice powder, and holds a secret cocktail in nature: a bright red, fruity apple and pear mushroom decorated with a complex array of wild and wonderful game and vegetables. Great wine: Earlier this year, Anzuiz and the team launched Alinea Wine, a wine tasting menu centred on over 100 courses of wine from across Europe and the Americas. Expectations are high that the restaurant and its owners will bring their collective produtio to life in future projects. Worth noting: The glass-walled kitchen allows diners to see a pineapple slowly roasting to on an elevated spit, the centrepiece of the famed (and delicious) Tipsy Cake dessert.Portrait: Karon Photography / Dishes: Albert Adrià
Innovative New American cuisine served in a majestic former bank The space: In the summer of 2017, shortly after being named The Best Restaurant in the World, Eleven Madison Park closed for a facelift. It reopened with a clean, updated aesthetic marked by cobalt blue mohair banquettes, terrazzo tiling, and a blue painting by artist Rita Ackermann that presides over the dining room. The team also expanded the bar area to make room for additional lounge tables. On the plate: When Eleven Madison Park reopened post renovation, chef Daniel Humm’s plating took on a more minimalist, almost Nordic aesthetic. His iconic lavender and honey roast duck morphed into a honey glazed duck with apple and rutabaga, and he introduced what has become an instant hit: a savoury cheesecake made from smoked sturgeon, anointed with a mountain of caviar. Keep it quick: For those looking to experience a shorter meal, the bar offers an abbreviated five-course tasting menu, as compared to the dining room’s eight to 10 plates. About the chef: Swiss-born chef Humm started working in kitchens at age 14, and earned his first Michelin star at 24. He became executive chef at Eleven Madison Park in 2006 when the restaurant was owned by Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group. In 2011

The room: In one of the world’s most plush and luxurious dining rooms, guests enjoy elegant vegetable- and sea-focused tasting menus under a giant glittering chandelier cascading with Swarovski crystals. Pod-esque curved benches are sheathed in glossy steel, deriving their inspiration from domes used to cover plates. A tall oak alcove wraps around a single table, “Table Cabane,” providing extra privacy, bearing an interior relief design pattered to look like a mushroom. Fun fact: Ducasse added the Shojin Menu specifically for vegetarians. It embraces a style of cookery called shojin – centuries-old vegetarian cuisine consumed by Zen Buddhist monks in Japan; also the predecessor to elegant Japanese kaiseki cuisine.

How to find it: The rather unexpected locale of a national soccer stadium serves as Geranium’s backdrop. The restaurant is located on the facility’s eighth floor, and its dining room affords ample room for both full- and part-time guests. Ask management to tour the rear kitchen area for a look at the most epic of sports stadium field views. Fun fact: While Kofoed heads up kitchen operations, partner Søren Ledet manages the dining room and wine. But when Geranium opened in 2007, those roles were yet to be defined. Since both men counted chef backgrounds, they initially planned to each spend time cooking and running the front-of-house. But Kofoed quickly found himself romanced by the kitchen, while Ledet fell in love with hospitality and booze––landing them in the positions they command today. Over the years, Ledet’s 2,500-bottle wine list, which spans from classic selections to natural-leaning juice, has won numerous accolades, including Wine Spectator’s prestigious Grand Award. This year, his dedication to exceptional service wins Geranium The Ferrari Trento Art of Hospitality Award.Images: Claes Bech-Poulsen Edible art: The seemingly unlikely duo of nature and technology are at the heart of chef Rasmus Kofoed’s progressive tasting menu: 17-plus inspired, artistic courses composed of organic and wild Scandinavian ingredients. While a presentation of fragile, near-translucent leaves is made from a Jerusalem artichoke purée, what look to be razor clams are actually dough painted with squid ink. About the chef: Counting quite the impressive CV, Rasmus Kofoed is the first chef in Denmark to have earned three Michelin stars, which the French fine dining guide granted to Geranium in 2016. Kofoed is also the only chef to have ever won the gold, silver and bronze medals at the esteemed global cooking competition the Bocuse d’Or, and his meticulous approach to seasonal Danish cuisine has seen Geranium climb its way up The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list from No.49 in 2012 to No.19 this year.

Who’s at the stove: Swiss chef Andreas Caminada, who is at the helm with Crippa and Crippa Axprize winner Andrea Fazzari.

What’s on the menu: Badger offers several signature dishes, most famous among them ‘Fish’ sourced from the Como River,’ the source of much of the dish making. Other signature dishes include the ‘Likki’s ‘jambú’ traditional fish-shaped stick with caviar, and the ‘Sühle’ original Mikkeller iced tea. While the tasting menu takes some inspiration from the Mikkeller empire in Asia, many of the dishes were created by Sühle’s employees, including himself, with the aim of enriching his busy kitchen with something unique. What’s on the menu: Badger has kept itself at the forefront of modern innovation in recent years with the launch of their lip-service mouthwash, and the restaurant’s nod to natural flavours in their cuisine. Filled with ingredients that many eat in their own stomach, the mouthwash encapsulates the best of Normandy, allowing everyone to taste one of the many luxuries of modern France. X
Japanese cuisine with quality, creativity and a warm welcome (plus an ant or two) Who’s in the kitchen? Chef Zaiyu Hasegawa began his career at age 18 in the kitchen of a ryotei (exclusive traditional Japanese restaurant) in Tokyo’s Kagurazaka geisha area, where his mother worked. Eleven years later he opened Den, which moved to its current location in late 2016. The philosophy: Rather than sticking to the elegant, refined but often impersonal traditions of high-end kaiseki cuisine, Hasegawa offers an elevated, deeply personal take on Japanese home cooking. He draws on diverse influences, both home-grown and gleaned on overseas trips, but always based around prime ingredients from ocean, pasture and forest. Any house-specials? So many, and most of them changing with the seasons. But constant points of reference include the signature foie gras monaka (wafer sandwich) as an

The menu: Nahm is a family affair that brought Mirazur to life in a matter of months, before ramen took the stage and entertained guests with a range of dishes and ingredients that many don’t know about themselves. Here, Ishizu describes himself as a native of Fukuoka, Japan, who left home at 19 and spent eight years cutting his teeth in some of Europe’s most venerated kitchens, including those of Paul Bocuse and Joël Robuchon. In 1996, he returned home to Japan and opened La Napoule in Kanagawa Prefecture. Seven years later, he moved to his current space in Tokyo’s non-touristy district of Minami Aoyama and formed Les Créations de Mirazur. After eight years of service, he renamed the restaurant simply Mirazur. What’s on the plate: Mirazur is a reed that’s “lies” served on a spitoy-style surface, like a mushroom risotto. The menu is designed to enrich the senses, with dishes such as beef short rib and mushroom chicken and wooden scallops and cuts of salmon, hand-picked in a showroom full of technicians. Who’s at the stove: Mirazur’s head chef is Gianni Lombardi, who runs the front of house. Other projects: Mirazur’s head chef is Valter Kramar, who runs the back of house. Kramar left for a stint at René Redzepi’s Noma in Copenhagen before opening Mirazur with his wife Alejandra Flores in 2012. Flores and her charismatic team run the front-of-house at Mirazur. Urban garden: Mirazur’s ambitious garden is a result of the restaurant’s unique blend of botanicals and other luxury ingredients, and its opening retains that unique Baileysque quality. It also recycles its own supermarket produce, according to chef Victor Arguin, who also serves the River Plateat dessert from time to time.

Nordic passion and precision on a plate Who, where, what and when? Maaemo’s 35-year-old head chef and co-owner, Esben Holmboe Bang, hails from Denmark but has made Oslo his home for the past 13 years. Since opening in 2010, Maaemo has become one of the most in-demand destination restaurants in all of Scandinavia. Mission statement: Holmboe Bang says that his focus at Maaemo is on a complete experience that allows him to highlight “the relationship between the raw nature, produce and our cultural history.” A culinary journey through a Nordic landscape: Reflecting the name – Maaemo is ancient Norse for “Mother Earth” – the menu is based almost entirely on ingredients sourced from the surrounding region.

About the chef: After dining two consecutive nights at St. John and The Fat Duck as a 20-something graduate, James Lowe was so blown away by the extremely different experiences that he became convinced that he too should run a restaurant. Jacking in his dream of becoming a pilot and notching up experience with Heston Blumenthal, St. John and a longer stint at The River Café, Lowe then took the pop-up route with chef friends Ben Greeno and Isaac McHale (see The Clove Club) under the Young Turks moniker. Four years ago, he opened up a permanent space with John
