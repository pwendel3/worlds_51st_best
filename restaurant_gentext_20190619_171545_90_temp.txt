Epitaph: Consistently ranked as The Best Restaurant in Australasia, Attica is the brainchild of chef Ben Shewry, originally hailing from New Zealand. In a discreet spot in Melbourne’s Ripponlea neighbourhood, he serves up an elaborate menu of fresh Australian produce in a cosy dining room and vegetable garden. What’s on the menu? A meal at Attica takes diners through a series of dishes and ingredients that are unfamiliar to many Australians, let alone international gastronomes. Rather than foie gras, caviar or lobster, the chef serves his own version of luxury, including pearl cooked in paperbark, hand-picked crab with wattle bread, grilled marron with desert lime and even bunya bunya (Shewry’s favourite ingredient). Each course has its own colourful name, such as Our Vegemite, Our Salada, Tac’Oz and Pests of the Neighbourhood. Some highlights: Among many other must-eat dishes on the menu is the whipped emu egg, served instead a large, open emu eggshell. Red kangaroo is another mainstay and the marron, similar to crayfish, is unmissable.Images: Colin Page What makes it special: Consistently ranked as The Best Restaurant in Australasia, Attica is the brainchild of chef Ben Shewry, originally hailing from New Zealand.

Minimalist grill cookery using premiere Basque ingredients What makes it special: Chef Victor Arguinzoniz has a remarkable ability to coax out explosive flavour from seemingly simple ingredients, most of which are grilled over an open hearth. What’s on the menu: Arguinzoniz respects the intrinsic natural flavours of premiere local products and delicately urges each ingredient to show its potential: goat’s milk churned into ethereal butter, green peas amplified in their own juice, beef dry aged for so many days it burns with umami. Arguinzoniz cooks vegetables and proteins – including ice cream – on a range of charcoals he makes from a variety of woods, kissing most plates with at least a suggestion of smoke. About the chef: Arguinzoniz was born and raised in the farming community of Axpe, a tiny picturesque village nestled in the mountains an hour’s drive from Bilbao. He is self-taught and has only worked in one kitchen – his own – where he designed and built his famous adjustable-heat grills. A lack of pretense: Despite its world-renowned status, what separates Etxebarri from many other world-class restaurants is its simple – boarding on austere – second-floor, stone-adorned dining room that’s totally unpretentious. Eccentric maître d’ and sommelier Agustí Peris presides over the front-of-house operations, presenting an effortless and relaxed service style and natural charm. Etxebarri’s ground floor houses a basic bar that also doubles as the village pub.

The historic palace features a painting by Argentine artist Andrea Barbera that presides over the dining room. She reveals the true story of the hotel’s unmissable treat: White as pie, with caviar and lobster, but with a more intimate take on Italiana than most places. It's a discipline that propelled the restaurant back onto The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2017, knocking its slot down to No.49.
A journey through Perugia’s produce with an introduction by the road‎: This is where the production truly starts, the first-floor experience of Abruzzo’s mechanized kitchen, and the relaxed & friendly vibe is melting away at the local ingredients. It could have been different: In its early days, the restaurant almost closed after conservative locals were resistant to Bottura’s tradition-busting approach to the Italian kitchen. Thankfully, the locally born chef and his American wife Lara Gilmore persevered. Now, of course, Bottura is feted by fellow chefs, critics and diners both closer to home and from across the globe. On the menu: Bottura weaves a range of narratives through his dishes, playing with ingredients from the surrounding Emilia-Romagna region. Courses include the now-famous (and equally delicious) Five Ages of Parmigiano Reggiano, which takes the diner through the region’s esteemed cheese in different temperatures, textures and tastes, as well as Adriatic Chowder. The latter takes the form of pie crust ‘pirate ship’ filled with sea snails, razor clams, blue lobster and truffle clam chowder as a representation of travel, seasonality and the local coastline. Food meets art: The kitchen’s creations are heavily influenced by art and music (in particular, jazz), and the dining space is made up of three elegant rooms that are adorned with high-quality contemporary artwork.

Colin Page was a big personality with high-profile international projects, but Kolkata-born chef Anand has been it first – and certainly not the last – on The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list. Backed by one of Asia’s most prestigious culinary laboratories, Anand has become a hub of creativity and, at times, madness. Modern Japanese-style nigiri sushi with Wagyu beef or seafood barböl is a mainstay and the nightly haute cuisine often includes mussels, bald eel and black truffle pudding. The chef-director pairing is refreshing and at times explosive, with Nikkei’s roots and influences in Singapore being their inspiration. But often unexpected takes lead, often involving stranger things: the unlikely duo of Gastón Vichy and Geranium chef-pitches opens Arpège on a journey through his family heritage, including the cookery arts, new seafood dishes and drinks. If you’re still hungry: In late 2016, shortly after being named The World’s Best Restaurant, Anand left his role as executive chef on The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list to pursue his passion for cooking.  What makes it special: The key ingredient infused into every Alinea meal isn’t a mountain of caviar, or a fat puck of foie gras. Since Alinea’s debut in 2005, chef and owner Grant Achatz has built a reputation for designing dishes spiked with emotion; eliciting playful nostalgia from his diners via sophisticated riffs off a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or pheasant served with smouldering oak leaves – aromas of fall.  What’s on the menu: Alinea has kept itself at the forefront of modern creativity via edible vanilla beans, langoustine yuba, crystal clear pumpkin pie and what has become Alinea’s most famous dish: an edible, helium-filled, floating balloon designed by former executive chef Mike Bagale. Best seat in the house: To commemorate Alinea’s 10th birthday, Achatz shuttered his wildly successful restaurant for four months, giving the place a total overhaul. When Alinea reopened in June 2017, the temple of haute cuisine emerged with a clean and bright look, in addition to a new dining experience: a glassed-in kitchen table. With room for four to six din

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds With centrepiece of the year: The Cosme hotel, which offers stunning views over Piazza San Marco, marking the venue’s first visit to such a stunning location.
Inventive local cuisine with global flavourpace The chef: Enrique Olvera, who took over the then-empty castle in Bali’s waters in 2005 after falling victim to a drunk driver, and who since has grown and developed the restaurant with relentless passion. Olvera is also the cookery director at the former Casadonna monastery, whichrenessfully abuts the restaurant with preserved wild and reared game and seasonal veg. What’s on the menu: Olvera and his team offer a nine-course tasting menu of up to 18 courses (plus and minus) designed to enrich the senses. The first-floor tasting room is a shrine to everything that is Peruvian, including many ingredients that are seldom served elsewhere. The room: In one of the world’s most plush and luxurious dining rooms, guests enjoy elegant vegetable- and sea-focused tasting menus under a giant glittering chandelier cascading with Swarovski crystals. Pod-esque curved benches are sheathed in glossy steel, deriving their inspiration from domes used to cover plates. A tall oak alcove wraps around a single table, “Table Cabane,” providing extra privacy, bearing an interior relief design pattered to look like a mushroom.

Complexity, but not complicated. A meal at Mikla is not complete without a trip to the top of modern Asian home cooking, but it is far from the journeyman approach as Nikkei, one of the most acclaimed restaurants in the world. With less than 10 year to run, Nikkei remains one of the mosteraiingly old-fashioned restaurants in all of Japan. It boasts one of the finest cellars in Japan, with wines poured to the accompaniment of a pumping 80s and 90s rock-classic soundtrack. It uses ultra-luxury ingredients, often eaten with the hands, and the kitchen employs super-sophisticated contemporary techniques alongside the ancient practice of cooking meat over fire. Who’s behind it: The brilliant and mercurial chef talent of Joshua Skenes is complemented by co-owner and wine director Mark Bright’s smooth delivery. They are currently expanding their portfolio with the opening of seafood-grill restaurant Angler on the SF harbour side, with one to follow in Los Angeles late in 2018. On the menu: The nightly changing tasting menu of up to 18 courses not only showcases the highest-quality produce but is guided by what is best on that very day. Dishes may feature Skenes’s Liquid Toast, a glazed sea urchin served on crusty bread soaked in a rich sauce of grilled bread and dusted with a powder of river vegetables; or barbecued celeriac slow-cooked in the fireplace for three days. Chefs step out from the barrier-free kitchen into the dining room to explain each dish. Bonus point: Skenes is shortly to open his own hideaway ranch up in the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state.Portrait: Bonjwing Lee How to define it: Indefinable?

An ancient practice that allows wine to gracefully slide from the floors of Roca Paduan into the walls of Aircassador’s most famous restaurant is Shojin RyuGin, which stands for Sai GouWen. Born in rural China and raised in the fishing community of Shimla, RyuGin was encouraged by his father to turn his passion for cooking into a profession and, after studying culinary arts in the US, he went to Japan to learn about his cultural and culinary heritage. He spent many months washing dishes before learning vital knife skills and eventually how to cook rice and make sushi. He took a job at the Sheraton on returning to Japan and, some years later, opened Maido. Other ventures: RyuGin moved to his current space in Tokyo’s non-touristy district of Minami Aoyama and formed Les Créations de Narisawa. After eight years of service, he renamed the restaurant simply Narisawa. What’s on the plate: Narisawa defines his food as “innovative Satoyama,” the word “Satoyama” representing a border zone between mountain foothills and flat land where people live sustainably with nature. Narisawa expresses this culture of respecting the earth through an elaborate omakase. Diners fall under the spell of the season, and sample fleeting flavours from provinces around the country. Depending on the season, some might try a broth made from a poisonous snake that resides in the waters near Okinawa, or a warm sashimi course of langoustine from Suruga Bay.  To drink: Narisawa is one of the best places in the world to appreciate the finest of Japanese winemaking, with Pinot Noir from Nagano, Riesling from Iwate and aged Bordeaux-style blends from Yamagata. Of course there’s sake, too.  On the road: In 2017, Narisawa teamed up with celebrated Brazilian food photographer Sergio Coimbra on an exhibit titled Satoyama, which debuted in São Paulo, featuring photos of the chef’s nature-inspired plates. Most recently, the show jumped seas to Los Angeles, where Narisawa and Coimbra’s collective work was on display during the month of May. Images: Sergio Coimbra Chef’s story: Yoshihiro Narisawa left home

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Hons: Maximilien Collin is the first woman to run the flagship restaurant at the Como Metropolitan hotel in Bangkok after legendary cook David Thompson left for pastures new in 2018, having worked with Como hotels for 18 years. Bangkok native Collin gave up a career in Silicon Valley to pursue her passion for cooking, becoming a chef in 2014 with the opening of her Michelin-starred restaurant, Kin Khao, in San Francisco. On the menu: Nahm is famed for its fiery modern takes on traditional Thai dishes and a meal here is a banquet of hearty plates rather than tiny bites. Signatures include steamed red curry of scallops with Thai basil and coconut, hot and sour soup of river prawn and wild mushrooms and coconut and turmeric curry of blue swimmer crab with kalamansi lime. The vibe: A meal at Nahm is a luxury experience, with a low-lit dining room and the opulent surroundings of the Como Metropolitan including the stunning night-lit view of the crystal blue swimming pool and veranda. A bit of history: Following on from the first Nahm in London, which opened in 2000 and closed some years later, the Bangkok restaurant launched in 2010 with a menu influenced by the street food of Bangkok and by centuries-old cookbooks belonging to private Thai households. In 2014, Nahm was voted No.1 in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants.Images: COMO Metropolitan Bangkok
A treat for the senses with light and dark in a quirky, industrial space What makes it unique: The first fine dining restaurant to open in Cape Town’s gentrifying Woodstock, The Test Kitchen kicked off an artistic boom. With food based on popular global dishes with South African ingredients and twists, chef Luke Dale-Roberts’s restaurant has two intimate dining areas – one “dark”, one “light”. About the chef: Luke Dale-Roberts was born in rural England and had an active youth, fishing and spending hours in nature. Too fidgety to enjoy a regimented school day, he excelled at cooking school as a teen. Work in the UK, Bali, South Korea and Japan opened his eyes to a world of technique and ingredients, which Dale-Roberts adopts at the restaurant – it encapsulates his discipline in delivering exquisite sauces and bold flavours.

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Wagyu Wagyu is one of the most locally born chefs in the world. He is also the only chef to have ever won the gold, silver and bronze medals at the esteemed global cooking competition the Bocuse d’Or, and his meticulous approach to seasonal Danish cuisine has seen Geranium climb its way up The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list from No.49 in 2012 to No.19 this year. How to find it: The rather unexpected locale of a national soccer stadium serves as Geranium’s backdrop. The restaurant is located on the facility’s eighth floor, and its dining room affords panoramic views of Fælledparken (Common Gardens). Ask management to tour the rear kitchen area for a look at the most epic of sports stadium field views. Fun fact: While Kofoed heads up kitchen operations, partner Søren Ledet manages the dining room and wine. But when Geranium opened in 2007, those roles were yet to be defined. Since both men counted chef backgrounds, they initially planned to each spend time cooking and running the front-of-house. But Kofoed quickly found himself romanced by the kitchen, while Ledet fell in love with hospitality and booze––landing them in the positions they command today. Over the years, Ledet’s 2,500-bottle wine list, which spans from classic selections to natural-leaning juice, has won numerous accolades, including Wine Spectator’s prestigious Grand Award. This year, his dedication to exceptional service wins Geranium The Ferrari Trento Art of Hospitality Award.Images: Claes Bech-Poulsen Edible art: The seemingly unlikely duo of nature and technology are at the heart of chef Rasmus Kofoed’s progressive tasting menu: 17-plus inspired, artistic courses composed of organic and wild Scandinavian ingredients. While a presentation of fragile, near-translucent leaves is made from a Jerusalem artichoke purée, what look to be razor clams are actually dough painted with squid ink. About the chef: Counting quite the impressive CV, Rasmus Kofoed is the first chef in Denmark to have earned three Michelin stars, which the French fine dining guide granted to Geranium in 2016. Kofoed is also the only chef to have ever

Modern Japanese cuisine with style and originality Where have you heard that name before? Chef Seiji Yamamoto hails from nearby Kagawa Prefecture in Shikoku, where he trained for over a decade at the revered Aoyagi restaurant. In 2003, at the age of 33, he opened Nihonryori RyuGin in the heart of Tokyo’s cosmopolitan Roppongi district. Eating with the seasons: Yamamoto’s menu changes constantly throughout the year to reflect the finest produce of each season. Among the many highlights are the grilled ayu (sweetfish) in summer; matsutake mushrooms with Wagyu beef from Kagawa in early autumn; matsubagani crabs from November to December; and wild torafugu blowfish in the winter months. Keeping it contemporary: Yamamoto initially gained recognition for integrating avant-garde modernist cooking techniques in his cuisine, but he has always been deeply grounded in the kaiseki tradition. Enter the dragon: From the décor to the table settings, dragons have a powerful presence in the dining room. This motif reflects the restaurant name: Nihonryori simply means “Japanese cuisine,” while RyuGin is a term used in Zen Buddhism, meaning “dragon’s voice.” International presence: RyuGin has two overseas branches. The first, Tenku RyuGin, opened in Hong Kong in 2012, and debuted on the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2014. Then, in 2015, Yamamoto opened Shoun RyuGin in Taipei, which made its first appearance in the Asia’s 50 Best list in 2018. New beginnings: After more than 15 year in Roppongi, in summer 2018 Yamamoto relocated his iconic restaurant to a plot three times the size of the original, now claiming nearly 5,000 square feet in Tokyo’s new Hibiya Midtown luxury development. Diners pick between seats in the main dining room, one of two private rooms, or one semi-private room. Who, what, where and when? One of Tokyo’s most dynamic interpreters of traditional Japanese cuisine, chef Seiji Yamamoto hails from rural Kagawa Prefecture in Shikoku, where he trained for over a decade at the revered Aoyagi restaurant.

Japanese chef Takeshi ‘Goh’ Fukuyama is considered by many to be the natural heir to the title of Japan’s most pioneering chef after Ferran Adrià. Treating Mugaritz as a research lab, he encourages innovation and creativity in all of his staff. How does it play out? A meal takes place over 20 courses – several of them, if the weather is clement, served in the gorgeously appointed gardens around the restaurant. Basque cuisine often combines elements of the mountains and the sea, and so it is at Mugaritz where the menu might roam from lettuce hearts with chorizo and house-cured salmon bonbon, via aged mole leaves and bone marrow presented in a book, to tigernut ice cream with fresh fried rice. What’s the vibe: One of the greatest things about Mugaritz is the sense of play, whether it’s the waiters throwing a curve-ball for the wine lovers at the table with a mystery bottle (a well-aged rosé from Lebanon’s Chateau Musar, perhaps), or the presentation of chocolate petit fours in stacked oak boxes designed to allude to the seven deadly sins. Bonus point: In summer 2018, Mugaritz is hosting the first-ever winner of a 50 Best BBVA Scholaship, aspiring Taiwanese chef Jessie Liu.Portrait: Alex Iturralde; images: Jose Luis López de Zubiria

Opened in 1994, over the years the restaurant and its owners have grown exponentially, changing concept to focus exclusively on Peruvian culture, dishes and ingredients, as well as moving house: the eponymous restaurant relocated to Casa Moreyra in Lima’s San Isidro district in 2014.  What makes it special: All areas are finely tuned at Astrid y Gastón, starting with the most recent menu, a tribute to Lima. Star dishes served à la carte or as part of the tasting menu include Peking-style guinea pig bao, grilled octopus with a pseudo-cereal salad and lucuma gnocchi. Chef patron Gastón – who picked up the 2018 Diners Club Lifetime Achievement Award – and his team have taken home a cluster of accolades over the years, ranking first in the inaugural Latin America’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2013, the Art of Hospitality Award in 2017 and Latin America’s Best Pastry Chef for Gutsche in 2015. The space: With a past dating back 300 years, Casa Moreyra continues to make history but of a gastronomic kind. The former plantation house is home to a bar, private rooms, development kitchen, patio and kitchen garden; the tasting menu kicks off outside on the lovely terrace before moving into a minimalist salon.

One of French Riviera’s most iconic restaurants is turning dishes from traditional Basque dishes to avenge deadly sins over the years, according to chef Zaiyu Hasegawa. Starting with a team of only four employees, Hasegawa has grown and developed the restaurant with relentless passion, now running a team of 40 and with three Michelin stars to his name. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, a dinner at Schloss Schauenstein is a warm and immersive experience from the moment you are greeted by the attentive staff at the door. The menu is designed to enrich the senses, with dishes such as beef, apple and mustard, or Swiss pikeperch fish, artichoke and mushrooms. Bonus point: Caminada oversees a biannual bookazine called Caminada Documenta, where he discusses and reveals the sources of his culinary inspiration and shares the stories behind the dishes, often involving other art forms or exotic travels. Portrait: V. Hoegger Destination restaurant? Yes, in the truest sense – Schloss Schauenstein is housed in a fairy tale castle in the Swiss Alps. The restaurant and six-room boutique hotel sits in the historic village of Fürstenau, which, with only eight full-time residents, claims the title of the smallest town in the world. Worth the trip? The remote location means that Schloss Schauenstein is enveloped in a beautiful and romantic atmosphere. The food – from characteristic preparations with a single ingredient to balanced flavours and precise presentation – has been fine-tuned over the years, resulting in surprising flavours even from the simplest ingredients. Who’s at the stove: Swiss chef Andreas Caminada, who fell in love with fine dining after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20. He took over the then-empty castle in Fürstenau in 2003, when he was only 26 years old, to realise his vision of an all-around hospitality experience for his guests.

Delicious British cuisine from a talented kitchen and dining room trio Why visit: The Clove Club’s interpretation of ‘modern British’ is refreshing and full of surprises, with fresh produce from all over the island reinvented in creations that put forward natural flavours and playfully mingle with tradition. Who’s in the kitchen: Scottish chef Isaac McHale is at the helm with Daniel Willis and Johnny Smith overseeing the dining room. The three friends used to run an experimental supper club in Shoreditch, East London, before opening The Clove Club in 2013. McHale trained at The Ledbury, Noma and Eleven Madison Park prior to embarking on his own venture. On the menu: There is a full tasting menu and a shorter version with five courses (also available at lunchtime), as well as wine and ‘ambient tea’ pairings. The signature raw Orkney scallop (from the eponymous archipelago north of Scotland) with Périgord truffle, hazelnut and mandarin is among the most Instagrammed dishes, together with the ‘parten bree’ Scottish spider crab hot pot, inspired by a traditional Scottish soup. As dessert, you may taste burnt clementine granite and buttermilk mousse. The space: Set within the historic Shoreditch Town Hall, the blue-tiled dining room has a relaxed East London vibe with an open kitchen and laid-back service. However, every guest is well looked after by the expert staff, who don’t miss an opportunity to heighten the dining experience. If you’re still hungry: In late 2016, McHale and the team opened Luca restaurant in Clerkenwell, a more casual venue where he channels his inner Italian while still focusing on British seasonal ingredients.Images: Jean Cazals Why visit: The Clove Club’s interpretation of ‘modern British’ is refreshing and full of surprises, with fresh produce from all over the island reinvented in creations that put forward natural flavours and playfully mingle with tradition.

“Owner’s Stone Barns, which provide lodging for the most iconic dishes in modern Scottish cuisine, relocated to their current location in the arty McGraths pub in March 2017. With only four full-time residents, the landmark establishment is actually a small, smattering of stars: First Minister, peer, mother tongue and international chef friends Gabrielle Grasseiro, Jordi Barbot as Jordi, Gustavo Vivanco as Gustavo, and Gustavo Duarte as Gustavo. What’s on the plate: Arzak’s artistic offerings are divided between multiple tasting menus and an à la carte option. Expect unsung flavour combinations like roasted pigeon with vanilla and kimchi, and sometimes whimsical service pieces: a wheel of Vietnamese chocolate may hit the table atop a skateboard. What makes it special: The restaurant, situated atop a hill in San Sebastian, has been in the Arzak family for generations, but it was charismatic Juan Mari who revived the menu to make it what it is today. Restaurant interior: The restaurant counts several different dining rooms, including a light-filled downstairs space that’s formal yet relaxed. There’s also a secret kitchen table reserved for special guests. To drink: Arzak boasts an enormous wine cellar stocked with over 100,000 bottles from around the world.Images: jason mcgregor
A showcase of colour and diversity from all over Peru What makes it special: Chefs Virgilio Martínez and Pía León’s flagship restaurant is a shrine to everything that is Peruvian, including many ingredients that are seldom served elsewhere. The husband-and-wife team have been travelling the length and breadth of the country for several years to source interesting and unique produce from land, sea and mountains. On the menu: Martínez and León like to play with the many varieties of corn, potato and much more obscure products offered by Peru’s vastly biodiverse landscape. Classics include Land of Corn and Extreme Stems, with newer dishes such as Waters of Nanay featuring piranha fish served in an entire, sharp-tooth-filled piranha head. The menu explores every altitude, from 20 metres below sea level to 4,100 metres above it, in 17+ courses.

Yoshihiro Narisawa brings nature to the plate via innovative Satoyama cuisine Chef’s story: Yoshihiro Narisawa left home at 19 and spent eight years cutting his teeth in some of Europe’s most venerated kitchens, including those of Paul Bocuse and Joël Robuchon. In 1996, he returned home to Japan and opened La Napoule in Kanagawa Prefecture. Seven years later, he moved to his current space in Tokyo’s non-touristy district of Minami Aoyama and formed Les Créations de Narisawa. After eight years of service, he renamed the restaurant simply Narisawa. What’s on the plate: Narisawa defines his food as “innovative Satoyama,” the word “Satoyama” representing a border zone between mountain foothills and flat land where people live sustainably with nature.

2015 Walk of Fame’s Best Female Chef was a big win for Jen-Hsun Choi, who has always been a champion of the new-generation of Korean culinary talents. Now that Shendi has shuttered, Odette has taken over as The Best Restaurant in Asia in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants, and flies the flag for the Lion City on The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list. Expanding upon León’s flagship restaurant, Odette Swirls serves up a menu of 25 or more courses of rapid-fire small bites, many of which are eaten with the hands. Visit while you can: While León is currently the undisputed king of fast-food in Asia, he may be too, at least in theory. Over the years the Peruvian-born chef won competitions across many disciplines, including culinary arts, stress testing, audiovisual development and even zoology. Aside from the pot-smoked salmon marinated in a 'zeitgeistic' version of salmon, also known as the "pizzeria rotara",’will always grace the menu. It is a constant presence at the Rey Thesaurus, where diners can glimpse a glimpse of both Peruvian culture and the sometimes whimsical restaurant menu. Who’s at the stove: Chef and co-owner Julien Royer may look like he’s barely out of his teens, but he has serious pedigree. Having apprenticed under Michel Bras in his native France, Royer worked in the Caribbean and London before arriving in Singapore a decade ago. He established himself as the region’s rising star while at Jaan, before opening Odette in late 2015 at the grand National Gallery Singapore. What to expect: This is unashamedly a fine-dining restaurant, complete with white tablecloths and luxurious velvet banquettes, but it’s also very much a contemporary version. The colour palette is light, the décor elegant – much like Royer’s ultra-refined take on modern French food using ingredients carefully sourced from a global list of artisanal producers. Dishes to savour: Hokkaido Uni combines sea urchin, langoustine tartare, Granny Smith apple and caviar to stunning effect; Royer’s morels with veal sweetbreads and fresh asparagus has French terroir in spades;

What it is: The key ingredient infused into every Alinea meal isn’t a mountain of caviar, or a fat puck of foie gras.astook: The cheflic degree comes from the cheflic list that determines what ingredients are eaten – whether it’s veal sweetbreads, fresh baked potatoes or a taste of both flavours.What’s the vibe? Housed in a monolithic glass cube in Vienna’s Stadtpark, Steirereck’s is a purely modern restaurant. The space: centered on the human face and collective work on earth, Steirereck’s is a relatively simple and welcoming space. To drink: There’s a small selection of seasonal draft bottles from the expansive Hofzeitling menu, or choose from three tasting menus of the same name. Who’s at the stove: Swiss chef Andreas Caminada, who fell in love with fine dining after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20. He took over the then-empty castle in Fürstenau in 2003, when he was only 26 years old, to realise his vision of an all-around hospitality experience for his guests. Starting with a team of only four employees, Caminada has grown and developed the restaurant with relentless passion, now running a team of 40 and with three Michelin stars to his name. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, a dinner at Steirereck is a warm and immersive experience from the moment you are greeted by the attentive staff at the door. The menu is designed to enrich the senses, with dishes such as beef, apple and mustard, or Swiss pikeperch fish, artichoke and mushrooms. Bonus point: Caminada oversees a biannual bookazine called Caminada Documenta, where he discusses and reveals the sources of his culinary inspiration and shares the stories behind the dishes, often involving other art forms or exotic travels. Portrait: V. Hoegger Destination restaurant? Yes, in the truest sense – Schloss Schauenstein is housed in a fairy tale castle in the Swiss Alps.

Fresh Mexican cuisine from one of the hottest young chefs in the US Reasons to visit Cosme: Even before former US President Barack Obama had the good sense to add it to his dining list, Cosme was already one of the hippest places to eat in New York City. With a buzzing but relaxed vibe and exquisite food and service, it is as much a special occasion restaurant as a place to visit time and time again. Modern Mexican: Founded by Mexican chef Enrique Olvera and his business partners Santiago Perez and Santiago Gomez, Cosme has been run by young cook Daniela Soto-Innes since soon after it opened in 2014. While the menu takes some inspiration from Olvera’s flagship Pujol in Mexico City, many of the dishes were created by Soto-Innes, including her signature duck carnitas and must-try corn husk meringue dessert. A mezcal for every occasion: It wouldn’t be a product of Olvera if it didn’t serve mezcal, so of course there’s a bar and bar area with an extensive mezcal menu and a fun vibe. Girl power: Soto-Innes prides herself on having a kitchen staff that is 50% female, 50% male, with a mix of nationalities from all over the US, Latin America and beyond. She champions women, including her sous chef and pastry chef, and runs a relaxed kitchen, often with music, dancing and pre-service warm-up exercises. The chef won a James Beard Rising Star Award in 2016 at age 25. Other ventures: Olvera and Soto-Innes opened more casual Mexican restaurant Atla in New York in 2017. They’re currently working on a restaurant based on Cosme and Pujol in Los Angeles.Images: Kelt T Reasons to visit Cosme: Even before former US President Barack Obama had the good sense to add it to his dining list, Cosme was already one of the hippest places to eat in New York City.

Japanese chef Takeshi ‘Micha’ Tsumura left home at 19 and spent eight years cutting his teeth in some of Europe’s most venerated kitchens, including those of Paul Bocuse and Joël Robuchon. In 1996, he returned home to Japan and opened La Napoule in Kanagawa Prefecture. Seven years later, he moved to his current space in Tokyo’s non-touristy district of Minami Aoyama and formed Les Créations de Narisawa. After eight years of service, he renamed the restaurant simply Narisawa. What’s on the plate: Narisawa defines his food as “innovative Satoyama,” the word “Satoyama” representing a border zone between mountain foothills and flat land where people live sustainably with nature. Narisawa expresses this culture of respecting the earth through an elaborate omakase. Diners fall under the spell of the season, and sample fleeting flavours from provinces around the country. Depending on the season, some might try a broth made from a poisonous snake that resides in the waters near Okinawa, or a warm sashimi course of langoustine from Suruga Bay.  To drink: Narisawa is one of the best places in the world to appreciate the finest of Japanese winemaking, with Pinot Noir from Nagano, Riesling from Iwate and aged Bordeaux-style blends from Yamagata. Of course there’s sake, too.  On the road: In 2017, Narisawa teamed up with celebrated Brazilian food photographer Sergio Coimbra on an exhibit titled Satoyama, which debuted in São Paulo, featuring photos of the chef’s nature-inspired plates. Most recently, the show jumped seas to Los Angeles, where Narisawa and Coimbra’s collective work was on display during the month of May. Images: Sergio Coimbra Chef’s story: Yoshihiro Narisawa left home at 19 and spent eight years cutting his teeth in some of Europe’s most venerated kitchens, including those of Paul Bocuse and Joël Robuchon.

How it all began: A play on the word ‘borage’ in Spanish, Santiago de Chile-based Boragó deals in territory rather than technique, according to chef Rodolfo Guzmán. He and his energetic team source native Chilean products used by the Mapuche indigenous people, physically gathering them from the Andes, the Pacific coast and every hill and valley in between; they also work with tiny producers and foragers. The end result is Endémica, a menu starring diverse preparations that can change during the course of an evening according to produce supply, paired with natural and biodynamic wine or juices. How many endemic Chilean species will I eat? Nine years into Boragó and Guzmán’s understanding and timing with respect to when products flourish in particular micro seasons – and how to use them – is greater than ever. Take uvas de montaña, wild grapes (not actually grapes) from the conifer family available for just five weeks a year; they form part of a wild leaf and lamb salad. Loyo, for example, is a giant mushroom with a tiny four-week harvesting window. Besides serving ingredients that many customers have never heard of, Guzmán has also expanded his repertoire. In his own words: “Seven years ago, one ingredient meant one possibility. Today it means 300.” The space: Walk up to Boragó’s minimalist-style façade in the swanky Vitacura neighbourhood, and a whole lamb might well be slowly roasting on a cross-shaped spit on the terrace by the front door, a sign of flavours to come. Seated at tables made from Chiloé-sourced lumber, diners can witness some of the culinary action through the kitchen’s floor-to-ceiling windows; there’s also a small herb garden at the back. Ask to take a peek at the first-floor test kitchen, where Conectáz (see below) and other research magic takes place. Other projects: In 2017, Guzmán published his first book, Boragó: Coming from the South, a 100-recipe tome. He is also working on Conectáz, Chile’s first encyclopedia categorising and cataloguing Chilean products, at Test Kitchen and Lab Kitchen at Santiago’s Catholic University, where one fascinating discovery is turning vegetables into protein

It's not often that a British foodies faces down a culinary challenge in the world’s No.1 restaurant, so of course there’s Bebeto’s Ros, a rustic soup made from olive juice spherified through a process with calcium chloride, alginate and xanthan gum. It is accompanied by a tasting menu of ‘partum purée’ and a dessert infused with ‘essence of old book’. The former Information Age greeting card is absent, however, and instead create ‘Ros’s’ website. Back on top: The Peruvian restaurant at the corner of Runnymede and St James’s Park in Lima’s San Isidro district, where I live and work, provides an engaging and sometimes whimsical take on modern Peruvian cuisine. The husband-and-wife team run operations at so many other top-notch Asian restaurants that they could have taken Airbnb. But instead, they returned home to Peru and opened La Napoule in Lima’s San Isidro district in 2014.  What makes it special: All areas are finely tuned at Astridmoa, starting with the most recent menu, a tribute to Lima. Star dishes served à la carte or as part of the tasting menu include Peking-style guinea pig bao, grilled octopus with a pseudo-cereal salad and lucuma gnocchi. Chef patron Gastón – who picked up the 2018 Diners Club Lifetime Achievement Award – and his team have taken home a cluster of accolades over the years, ranking first in the inaugural Latin America’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2013, the Art of Hospitality Award in 2017 and Latin America’s Best Pastry Chef for Gutsche in 2015. The space: With a past dating back 300 years, Casa Moreyra continues to make history but of a gastronomic kind. The former plantation house is home to a bar, private rooms, development kitchen, patio and kitchen garden; the tasting menu kicks off outside on the lovely terrace before moving into a minimalist salon. Other projects: Peru’s gastronomic ambassador has found time to open El Bodegón in Lima, pen Peru: The Cookbook, launch LatinoAmerica Cocina with Buenos Aires restaurant Don Julio and he’s currently working with the Pontificia Universidad

New York Red Bulls 1. They’ve always been friends, before the duo met at the age of 20, and the two became good friends at Barranco where they worked together on a restaurant called Barranco. Then, in 2011, McHale took the helm at Barranco and opened El Bulli, which made its first appearance at the restaurant in person and presented a moving portrait of a restaurant built on top of top of Abyssinian Cuisine. What’s on the menu: Barranco’s artistic offerings are divided between multiple tasting menus and an à la carte option. Expect unsung flavour combinations like roasted pigeon with vanilla and kimchi, and sometimes whimsical service pieces: a wheel of Vietnamese chocolate may hit the table atop a skateboard. What makes it special: The restaurant, situated atop a hill in San Sebastian, has been in the Arzak family for generations, but it was charismatic Juan Mari who revived the menu to make it what it is today. Restaurant interior: The restaurant counts several different dining rooms, including a light-filled downstairs space that’s formal yet relaxed. There’s also a secret kitchen table reserved for special guests. To drink: Arzak boasts an enormous wine cellar stocked with over 100,000 bottles from around the world.Images: Mikel Alonso / Jose Lopez / Sara Santos / Restaurante Arzak The Chef: Elena Arzak is the daughter of Juan Mari Arzak, one of the founding fathers of contemporary Spanish cookery. During the 70s, Juan Mari helped ignite a movement toward avant-garde Basque cuisine, which set the stage for later legends like Ferran Adrià and José Andrés.

Inventive local cuisine with the best views in the world What makes it special? Consistently rated one of the best restaurants in Berlin, Alinea has been running an experimental supper club for the last decade or so. Since its opening, Alinea has become a byword for cutting-edge cooking rooted in the Austrian landscape. With a emphasis on seafood, the restaurant and its wings are a journey through the gastronomic landscape, with an emphasis on Asian cuisine. About the chef: Mehmet Zola was commissioned by the Austrian Restaurant Association to run their famous (and delicious) bar and grill club. Confidential sources: While the tasting menu of Austrian cuisine starts with the finest produce from every continent but Australasia, every year on October 1, Alinea hosts the first-ever Food and Wine Spectacular, inviting the world’s 50 Best Restaurants to enjoy an immersive dining experience with Alinea. The tasting menu of award-winning Austrian cuisine may include everything from green beans and Swiss chard to mutton, to dim sum and coconut and linen sweaters and sweetbreads. But the true gem of the region is its simple – and delicious – soup, a ruelly-sweet soup made from smoked sturgeon, anointed with a mountain of caviar. Keep it quick: For those looking to experience a shorter meal, the tasting menu now includes 20-ounce cans of one of the many ‘snacks’ available.

A taste of Piemonte, one of the finest food and wine regions of the world, through the sharply focused culinary lens of Enrico Crippa, now firmly established as among Italy’s most creative chefs. Diners can select from the à la carte options, or choose from three tasting menus, one of which focuses specifically on the local Langhe region, while the others are more wide-ranging (while still distinctively Italian). During white truffle season, tables are at even more of a premium than usual. More about the chef: Crippa opened Piazza Duomo in 2005 with the backing of the Ceretto family, themselves pioneers in the region’s winemaking resurgence of recent decades. A quiet and supremely dedicated professional, he trained and worked extensively in Europe and Japan and was mentored by the late great Italian chef Gaultiero Marchesi. Highlights: The restaurant’s most famous dish is the Salad 21, 31, 41, 51, which incorporates a cornucopia of leaves, herbs and vegetables, the precise number and make-up of which changes according to the season. However, it is the array of one- or two-bite flavour-filled starters – also primarily sourced from Piazza Duomo’s own farm-meets-kitchen garden, and served simultaneously – that linger longest in diners’ memories. And finally: Restaurant manager Vincenzo Donatiello leads a highly personable young service team in the restaurant’s two dining rooms – one that is famously pink-hued. Donatiello also happens to be one of the best sommeliers in Italy, if not the world, combining access to the Barolos and Barbarescos on his Langhe doorstep with a personal passion for Burgundy to curate a wonderful wine list full of surprises.

What’s on the menu: Yamamoto enhances his range of sustainably-minded dishes with innovative techniques, while Hiroyuki’s vision is to combine traditional Japanese cuisine with some of the best Thai cuisine on the planet. Something unique about Yamamoto’s cooking: His dishes are influenced by a wide variety of influences, from the most famous to the most obscure, from ancient Persian to Japanese-Peruvian to contemporary Japanese.

One of France’s most iconic chefs honours “naturalness” in an opulent dining room Clean cuisine: As one of the most legendary leaders in classic French haute cuisine, in 2014 Alain Ducasse overhauled his landmark fine dining destination in the luxe Parisian hotel of the same name. His new approach – one that propelled the restaurant back onto The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2017 after falling off the list in 2016 – prioritises sustainability, health and wellness-hinged plates focused on vegetables, fish and cereals. The room: In one of the world’s most plush and luxurious dining rooms, guests enjoy elegant vegetable- and sea-focused tasting menus under a giant glittering chandelier cascading with Swarovski crystals. Pod-esque curved benches are sheathed in glossy steel, deriving their inspiration from domes used to cover plates. A tall oak alcove wraps around a single table, “Table Cabane,” providing extra privacy, bearing an interior relief design pattered to look like a mushroom. Fun fact: Ducasse added the Shojin Menu specifically for vegetarians. It embraces a style of cookery called shojin – centuries-old vegetarian cuisine consumed by Zen Buddhist monks in Japan; also the predecessor to elegant Japanese kaiseki cuisine.

Creative dining experience from one of Spain's most innovative chefs Creative mind: Andoni Luis Aduriz, simply known as Andoni, is considered by many observers to be the natural heir to the title of Spain’s most pioneering chef after Ferran Adrià. Treating Mugaritz as a research lab, he encourages innovation and creativity in all of his staff. How does it play out? A meal takes place over 20 courses – several of them, if the weather is clement, served in the gorgeously appointed gardens around the restaurant. Basque cuisine often combines elements of the mountains and the sea, and so it is at Mugaritz where the menu might roam from lettuce hearts with chorizo and house-cured salmon bonbon, via aged mole leaves and bone marrow presented in a book, to tigernut ice cream with fresh fried rice. What’s the vibe? One of the greatest things about Mugaritz is the sense of play, whether it’s the waiters throwing a curve-ball for the wine lovers at the table with a mystery bottle (a well-aged rosé from Lebanon’s Chateau Musar, perhaps), or the presentation of chocolate petit fours in stacked oak boxes designed to allude to the seven deadly sins. Bonus point: In summer 2018, Mugaritz is hosting the first-ever winner of a 50 Best BBVA Scholas

Passard famously in 2001 announced that Arpège – until then a meat institution – was turning vegetarian, and although meat has since returned to the restaurant in smaller quantities, vegetables still take the main stage. They arrive daily from Passard’s own farms and appear on diners’ plates soon after. Signature dishes: Despite his ever-changing menu, Passard has managed to amass a number of signature dishes over the years, some so famous that diners book months in advance for the first taste of white asparagus in spring or the arrival of black truffles in winter. Other signature dishes include the dumplings, stuffed with seasonal vegetables, and the langoustine carpaccio with caviar.Images: Thomas Collin

More than 20 years ago, shortly after being announced as The Best Restaurant in Australasia, Burger King expanded to New Zealand. Following up on its first restaurant in New Zealand, in 2014, by making its debut on the list with one of the finest plates on the planet, Burger King’s Canadian presence is sure to take the crowd into the ever-changing culinary world of Canada. Diners pick between seats in the main dining room, one of two private rooms, or one semi-private room. Who’s at the stove: Executive chef David Attenborough is at the helm of Miller Brewing Co. in Hamilton, which recently added its first beer, named Meciem, at the discounted price of just €19.99 / person. Pronounced Hi-sha Franko, the name may suggest, but MaaAmo is actually a term used in Zen Buddhism, meaning “dragon’s voice.” The restaurant is located in the beautiful and cosmopolitan West Village, and has drawn visitors to Hamilton from all over the world. About the chef: Mehmet Gürs was credited as one of the cooks leading the change in Hamilton’s restaurant scene when he returned from the US to open his first restaurant in 1996. Aside from Mikki, the menu also includes the Chef’s Award-winner, Hamilton’s signature cauliflower mutton, with cauliflower rice and star anise distillate biscuits. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, a dinner at Mikki is a warm and immersive experience from the moment you are greeted by the attentive staff at the door. The menu is designed to enrich the senses, with dishes such as beef, apple and mustard, or Swiss pikeperch fish, artichoke and mushrooms. Bonus point: Caminada, the masterful grill cookery, is housed in a luxurious conservation cabin in the Vancouver River, where he runs a club of restaurants that, with the help of a tank, can improve the environment.
Inventive New American cuisine served in a cool and cosy setting The space: In the summer of 2017, shortly after being named The Best Restaurant in Australasia, Eleven Madison Park closed for a facelift.

An experimental restaurant and bar in Paris's Rennes-Reiche-Rheinau suburbality, Lacoste, or Lacoste, but mostly he refers to himself as Keitel. During the 70s and 80s, when Paris was still a small town small, Keitel worked with the Agence France Presse during the 70s and 80s to develop his brand. Today, he is synonymous with French cuisine and is one of the most visible leaders in the sector. With a buzzing but relaxed vibe and exquisite food and service, it is as much a special occasion restaurant as a place to visit time and time again. Modern Mexican: Founded by Mexican chef Enrique Olvera and his business partners Santiago Perez and Santiago Gomez, Cosme has been run by young cook Daniela Soto-Innes since soon after it opened in 2014. While the menu takes some inspiration from Olvera’s flagship Pujol in Mexico City, many of the dishes were created by Soto-Innes, including her signature duck carnitas and must-try corn husk meringue dessert. A mezcal for every occasion: It wouldn’t be a product of Olvera if it didn’t serve mezcal, so of course there’s a bar and bar area with an extensive mezcal menu and a fun vibe. Girl power: Soto-Innes prides herself on having a kitchen staff that is 50% female, 50% male, with a mix of nationalities from all over the US, Latin America and beyond. She champions women, including her sous chef and pastry chef, and runs a relaxed kitchen, often with music, dancing and pre-service warm-up exercises. The chef won a James Beard Rising Star Award in 2016 at age 25. Other ventures: Olvera and Soto-Innes opened more casual Mexican restaurant Atla in New York in 2017. They’re currently working on a restaurant based on Cosme and Pujol in Los Angeles.Images: Kelt T Reasons to visit Cosme: Even before former US President Barack Obama had the good sense to add it to his dining list, Cosme was already one of the hippest places to eat in New York City. With a buzzing but relaxed vibe and exquisite food and service, it is as much a special occasion restaurant as a place to visit time and time again. Modern Mexican

It also happens to deliver one of the very finest dining experiences in all of Scandinavia.Inspired by the legendary Arvika location, Eilandbergaz takes tourists through the historic village of Cowpe in what is now Denmark.

The Italian restaurant and wine bar Magoza Trento emerged from the global food and wine development chain Last.ButOneMore has taken home a Michelin star for it’s first winery award, sponsored by S.Pellegrino and Acqua Panna.Images: Paolo Terzi; portrait: Alessandro Moggi Believe the hype: Massimo Bottura may be a big personality with high-profile international projects, but Osteria Francescana remains a small, discreet restaurant in the relatively modest Italian town of Modena. It also happens to deliver one of the very finest dining experiences in the world, combining nods to tradition with fierce modernity, philosophical conceptions with old-fashioned flavour, warmth with daring. It could have been different: In its early days, the restaurant almost closed after conservative locals were resistant to Bottura’s tradition-busting approach to the Italian kitchen. Thankfully, the locally born chef and his American wife Lara Gilmore persevered. Now, of course, Bottura is feted by fellow chefs, critics and diners both closer to home and from across the globe. On the menu: Bottura weaves a range of narratives through his dishes, playing with ingredients from the surrounding Emilia-Romagna region. Courses include the now-famous (and equally delicious) Five Ages of Parmigiano Reggiano, which takes the diner through the region’s esteemed cheese in different temperatures, textures and tastes, as well as Adriatic Chowder. The latter takes the form of pie crust ‘pirate ship’ filled with sea snails, razor clams, blue lobster and truffle clam chowder as a representation of travel, seasonality and the local coastline. Food meets art: The kitchen’s creations are heavily influenced by art and music (in particular, jazz), and the dining space is made up of three elegant rooms that are adorned with high-quality contemporary artwork. Back on top: Osteria Francescana topped The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2016, was named No.2 in 2017 and returns to the summit in the 2018 edition as winner of The World’s Best Restaurant award, sponsored by S.Pellegrino and Acqua Panna.Images: Paolo Terzi; portrait: Alessandro Moggi

Contemporary Brazilian cuisine by rock star chef What's it all about? Former punk and DJ Alex Atala ripped up the rule book in true rock 'n' roll style when he set up D.O.M. in 1996, fusing fine dining with wild and wonderful ingredients from the Amazon basin.Typical dishes: Native ingredients are a hallmark of D.O.M., from jambú, a herb that creates a tingling sensation on the tongue, to Atala's now world-famous use of ants. Highlights include heart-of-palm fettuccine with butter, sage and popcorn powder and milk pudding flavoured with priprioca, an aromatic root previously used in the cosmetics industry.What's the vibe? High ceilings, slick service and a soothing cream-and-taupe colour scheme make for a pleasantly relaxed space, allowing the vibrant food to take centre stage.Other ventures: Atala's less formal restaurant Dalva e Dito and bar Riviera, both in São Paulo, were recently joined by Açougue Central (Central Butchery), a restaurant and butcher's shop serving lesser-known cuts of  meat, cooked on a huge charcoal grill.What's in a name? D.O.M. stands for Deo Optimo Maximo, which translates as 'To God, The Good, The Great'. The Benedictine motto was often used to indicate places where weary pilgrims could eat and rest.

====================
Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Far from the straightforward sit-down restaurant experience, at Azurmendi the journey starts in the rooftop vegetable garden where guests inspect the home-grown produce before continuing via the kitchen to an indoor greenhouse for a selection of ‘snacks’. Diners are eventually seated in a section of the dining room, flanked by temporary fabric walls projecting different scenes for different courses.The chef: Basque cook Eneko Atxa was brought up with the kitchen at the heart of his home and says he’s committed to giving guests the same homely experience. Azurmendi is a family business that also houses a winery run by his cousin, Bertol Izagirre, specialising in Basque txakoli wine.Other ventures: The chef opened Eneko at One Aldwych, a more relaxed version of Azurmendi, in London in 2016.On the menu: Highlights include Truffled egg, which is ‘cooked inside out’, with part of the yolk removed and replaced with truffle consommé, while Edible Cotton is a classic snack that guests eat in the greenhouse.Bonus point: Azurmendi first won The Sustainable Restaurant Award in 2014, and this year it once again gained the highest sustainbility rating, winning the award for a second time. Not only is the restaurant made with environmentally friendly materials, it also recycles its own waste, harvests rainfall and cools itself using geothermal energy.
Inventive local cuisine with the best views in the world What makes it special? Consistently rated one of the best restaurants in Istanbul, Mikla offers the full package of great service and exceptional food in a stunning location. With one of the finest views in the world, Mikla’s dining room has an outdoor terrace from which guests can look over the Bosphorus to see a glimpse of both Asia and Europe. About the chef: Mehmet Gürs was credited as one of the cooks leading the change in Istanbul’s restaurant scene when he returned from the US to open his first restaurant in 1996.

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Atala is the first woman to run the flagship restaurant at the Como Metropolitan hotel in Bangkok after legendary cook David Thompson left for pastures new in 2018, having worked with Como hotels for 18 years. Bangkok native Techamuanvivit gave up a career in Silicon Valley to pursue her passion for cooking, becoming a chef in 2014 with the opening of her Michelin-starred restaurant, Kin Khao, in San Francisco. On the menu: Nahm is famed for its fiery modern takes on traditional Thai dishes and a meal here is a banquet of hearty plates rather than tiny bites. Signatures include steamed red curry of scallops with Thai basil and coconut, hot and sour soup of river prawn and wild mushrooms and coconut and turmeric curry of blue swimmer crab with kalamansi lime. The vibe: A meal at Nahm is a luxury experience, with a low-lit dining room and the opulent surroundings of the Como Metropolitan including the stunning night-lit view of the crystal blue swimming pool and veranda. A bit of history: Following on from the first Nahm in London, which opened in 2000 and closed some years later, the Bangkok restaurant launched in 2010 with a menu influenced by the street food of Bangkok and by centuries-old cookbooks belonging to private Thai households. In 2014, Nahm was voted No.1 in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants.Images: COMO Metropolitan Bangkok
A treat for the senses with light and dark in a quirky, industrial space What makes it unique: The first fine dining restaurant to open in Cape Town’s gentrifying Woodstock, The Test Kitchen kicked off an artistic boom. With food based on popular global dishes with South African ingredients and twists, chef Luke Dale-Roberts’s restaurant has two intimate dining areas – one “dark”, one “light”. About the chef: Luke Dale-Roberts was born in rural England and had an active youth, fishing and spending hours in nature. Too fidgety to enjoy a regimented school day, he excelled at cooking school as a teen. Work in the UK, Bali, South Korea and Japan opened his eyes to a world of technique and ingredients, which Dale-Roberts adopts at the restaurant – it encapsulates his discipline in delivering exquisite sauces and bold flavours.

natural light ingredient exclusively sourced from the Soça Valley and its stunning natural light. Who’s behind it: The brilliant and mercurial chef talent of Joshua Skenes is complemented by co-owner and wine director Mark Bright’s smooth delivery. They are currently expanding their portfolio with the opening of seafood-grill restaurant Angler on the SF harbour side, with one to follow in Los Angeles late in 2018. On the menu: The nightly changing tasting menu of up to 18 courses not only showcases the highest-quality produce but is guided by what is best on that very day. Dishes may feature Skenes’s Liquid Toast, a glazed sea urchin served on crusty bread soaked in a rich sauce of grilled bread and dusted with a powder of river vegetables; or barbecued celeriac slow-cooked in the fireplace for three days. Chefs step out from the barrier-free kitchen into the dining room to explain each dish. Bonus point: Skenes is shortly to open his own hideaway ranch up in the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state.Portrait: Bonjwing Lee How to define it: Indefinable? Saison is, on the face of it, full of contradictions: a former weekly pop-up, it is now one of the most exclusive (and expensive) restaurants in the world. It boasts one of the finest cellars in the US, with wines poured to the accompaniment of a pumping 80s and 90s rock-classic soundtrack. It uses ultra-luxury ingredients, often eaten with the hands, and the kitchen employs super-sophisticated contemporary techniques alongside the ancient practice of cooking meat over fire.

Minimalist cooking techniques and unique presentations – what make it special? Restaurant Tim Raue has been in the Arzak family for generations, but it was charismatic Juan Mari who revived the menu to make it what it is today. Restaurant owners Raue and Rauegger serve up an elaborate menu of fresh Mexican-Indian dishes in a theatrical setting, in addition to the traditional mole and grits. The menu, which is invariably accompanied by a cheesecake, was conceived following extensive research into locales in order to better suit his own tastes. This year, his dedication to exceptional service wins Geranium The Ferrari Trento Art of Hospitality Award.Images: Claes Bech-Poulsen Edible art: The seemingly unlikely duo of nature and technology are at the heart of chef Geranium’s progressive tasting menu: 18-plus inspired, artistic courses composed of organic and wild Scandinavian ingredients. While a presentation of fragile, near-translucent leaves is made from a Jerusalem artichoke purée, what look to be razor clams are actually dough painted with squid ink. About the chef: Counting quite the impressive CV, Rasmus Kofoed is the first chef in Denmark to have earned three Michelin stars, which the French fine dining guide granted to Geranium in 2016. Kofoed is also the only chef to have ever won the gold, silver and bronze medals at the esteemed global cooking competition the Bocuse d’Or, and his meticulous approach to seasonal Danish cuisine has seen Geranium climb its way up The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list from No.49 in 2012 to No.19 this year. How to find it: The rather unexpected locale of a national soccer stadium serves as Geranium’s backdrop. The restaurant is located on the facility’s eighth floor, and its dining room affords panoramic views of Fælledparken (Common Gardens). Ask management to tour the rear kitchen area for a look at the most epic of sports stadium field views. Fun fact: While Kofoed heads up kitchen operations, partner Søren Ledet manages the dining room and wine. But when Geranium opened in 2007, those roles were yet to be defined. Since both men counted chef backgrounds, they initially planned to each spend time cooking and running the front-of-house. But Kofoed quickly found himself romanced by the kitchen, while Ledet fell

“A taste of pure Mexico from a talented young chef What’s in a name? Quintonil is the name of a green Mexican herb which features in some of the dishes and cocktails, and pretty much sums up this restaurant: fresh, authentic and brimming with flavour. Chef Jorge Vallejo’s menu is based on local produce and showcases the best of Mexico. What to order: Although there’s an à la carte option, those with time should pick the tasting menu for the true Quintonil experience. From crab tostadas with fresh radish and habanero chilli mayonnaise to charred avocado tartare and escamoles (ant eggs), there’s a taste of many of the things that make Mexican cuisine so unique. Everything is perfectly balanced, with palate cleansers such as cactus sorbet, so that every diner leaves happily satiated rather than uncomfortably stuffed. About the team: Vallejo worked on cruise ships before moving on to Enrique Olvera’s restaurant, Pujol, then a role as executive chef at Diana restaurant within Mexico City’s St. Regis Hotel. He left for a stint at René Redzepi’s Noma in Copenhagen before opening Quintonil with his wife Alejandra Flores in 2012. Flores and her charismatic team run the front-of-house at Quintonil. Urban garden: Much of the produce at Quintonil comes from a nearby garden, where the cooks pick fresh veg and greens on a daily basis. Vallejo and his team keep their carbon footprint so low that many of their ingredients travel just 30 metres from origin to plate. What’s in a name?

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Innovative food often starts with the heart – think Justin Bieber’s infectious grin as he sings about saving his country for the future, or the future of his restaurant: it could be any of the above. But for every brilliant chef we looked at a list of 25 or more that prioritises sustainability, or at least seeks out eco-friendly practices, such as washing dishes in the heat created by algae that are transported by air to the restaurant’s floor. How does it play out? A meal takes place over 20 courses – several of them, if the weather is clement, served in the gorgeously appointed gardens around the restaurant. Basque cuisine often combines elements of the mountains and the sea, and so it is at Mugaritz where the menu might roam from lettuce hearts with chorizo and house-cured salmon bonbon, via aged mole leaves and bone marrow presented in a book, to tigernut ice cream with fresh fried rice. What’s the vibe: One of the greatest things about Mugaritz is the sense of play, whether it’s the waiters throwing a curve-ball for the wine lovers at the table with a mystery bottle (a well-aged rosé from Lebanon’s Chateau Musar, perhaps), or the presentation of chocolate petit fours in stacked oak boxes designed to allude to the seven deadly sins. Bonus point: In summer 2018, Mugaritz is hosting the first-ever winner of a 50 Best BBVA Scholaship, aspiring Taiwanese chef Jessie Liu.Portrait: Alex Iturralde; images: Jose Luis López de Zubiria
Minimalist grill cookery using premiere Basque ingredients What makes it special: Chef Victor Arguinzoniz has a remarkable ability to coax out explosive flavour from seemingly simple ingredients, most of which are grilled over an open hearth. What’s on the menu: Arguinzoniz respects the intrinsic natural flavours of premiere local products and delicately urges each ingredient to show its potential: goat’s milk churned into ethereal butter, green peas amplified in their own juice, beef dry aged for so many days it burns with umami. Arguinzoniz cooks vegetables and proteins – including ice cream – on a range of charcoals he

More Montreal Canadiens memories than gems: It may be a large, extremely busy hotel restaurant in the posher part of west London, but don’t underestimate the ingenuity and originality of the dishes at Dinner, which retain the Blumenthal stamp, albeit in a very different guise to those at The Fat Duck. What’s more, dishes are delivered by super-friendly and well-versed staff. History lesson: The menu was conceived following extensive research into historical British dishes from as far back as the 14th Century, and has retained that unique niche since its opening. But while some creations have become world-famous – Meat Fruit, Rice & Flesh et al – there are lower-profile gems to look out for such as ‘grilledome bone marrow’ and ‘pork belly wattle (also from the menu). Will Heston be there? Not usually. The restaurant is led by chef-director Ashley Palmer-Watts, who has been with Blumenthal for almost two decades. At Dinner, which now includes a branch in Melbourne with another to come in Dubai in 2019, Palmer-Watts has established himself as an innovator in his own right. Worth noting: The glass-walled kitchen allows diners to see a pineapple slowly roasting to on an elevated spit, the centrepiece of the famed (and delicious) Tipsy Cake dessert.Portrait: Karon Photography / Dishes: John Blackwell What to expect: It may be a large, extremely busy hotel restaurant in the posher part of west London, but don’t underestimate the ingenuity and originality of the dishes at Dinner, which retain the Blumenthal stamp, albeit in a very different guise to those at The Fat Duck.

UFC light heavyweight champion Cain Velazquez apologises to Alinea restaurant for 'not respecting the traditions' of Mexican cuisine'

Former US President Barack Obama has agreed to take over as co-owner of Alinea, turning the restaurant from luxury resort into a full-time operation.The former White House chef relocated to New York in 2014 with the aim of turning Mexican cuisine into an international hit. Having worked with Alinea for almost two decades, President Barack Obama appointed Velazquez as co-owner on the bank Holiday card on Monday.The former New York and Los Angeles home of The Fat Duck and The Lightly Room is currently the hub of international Mexican cuisine, with many signature dishes including the Salad 21 and its inflectiony-named meringue-smoked salmon.Other ventures: Atala's less formal restaurant Dalva e Dito and bar Riviera, both in São Paulo, were recently joined by Açougue Central (Central Butchery), a restaurant and butcher's shop serving lesser-known cuts of  meat, cooked on a huge charcoal grill.What's in a name? D.O.M. stands for Deo Optimo Maximo, which translates as 'To God, The Good, The Great'.

Modern Basque cuisine from the family who helped found the movement The Chef: Elena Arzak is the daughter of Juan Mari Arzak, one of the founding fathers of contemporary Spanish cookery. During the 70s, Juan Mari helped ignite a movement toward avant-garde Basque cuisine, which set the stage for later legends like Ferran Adrià and José Andrés. Elena now fully runs operations, while 75-year-old Juan Mari takes a supporting role, tasting dishes, greeting customers and helping with menu creation. What’s on the plate: Arzak’s artistic offerings are divided between multiple tasting menus and an à la carte option. Expect unsung flavour combinations like roasted pigeon with vanilla and kimchi, and sometimes whimsical service pieces: a wheel of Vietnamese chocolate may hit the table atop a skateboard. What makes it special: The restaurant, situated atop a hill in San Sebastian, has been in the Arzak family for generations, but it was charismatic Juan Mari who revived the menu to make it what it is today.

Since both men counted chef backgrounds, they initially planned to each spend time cooking and running the front-of-house. But Kofoed quickly found himself romanced by the kitchen, while Ledet fell in love with hospitality and booze––landing them in the positions they command today. Over the years, Ledet’s 2,500-bottle wine list, which spans from classic selections to natural-leaning juice, has won numerous accolades, including Wine Spectator’s prestigious Grand Award. This year, his dedication to exceptional service wins Geranium The

throughout their one-off business, Zenith offers a large selection of Zenith装茅香腹腐腙 (Japanese:可能號), which translates as “Japanese-Friendly”.” Although mostly in Japanese, it has some English components, such as a citrus-infused tofu panna cotta, and a dessert infused with “Japanese-friendly” ingredients. What’s the vibe? Housed in a monolithic glass cube in Vienna’s Stadtpark, Steirereck’s design may be super-modern but the interior speaks a recognisable language of international fine dining. It’s a bright, tranquil vision of wood, concrete and starched white table linen.Typical dishes: Reitbauer’s signature says everything you need to know about his outlook, being equal parts culinary theatre, precise technique and obvious reverence of local ingredients. The freshwater mountain fish, char, is cooked at the table in hot beeswax before being returned on a plate with yellow carrot, pollen and sour cream.What else? While the tasting menu is, undoubtedly, the best way to engage with Reitbauer’s vision, the à la carte menu also includes plenty of gems – from a wild boar’s head with carrots, pineapple, radicchio and buckwheat to Forono beets with hempseed, new potatoes and woodruff.Portrait: Fotografin Kanizaj Marija
Spectacular views, creative cuisine and Russian talent A few words on the chef: Chef Vladimir Mukhin is in the vanguard of a new wave of young Russian culinary talents. Known as much for his use of local, seasonal ingredients as for his charisma, Mukhin is making international waves and appeared in the 2017 series of Netflix’s Chef’s Table.Typical dishes: Traditional Russian produce like borodinsky black bread marries luxe ingredients like caviar to create innovative dishes. Standouts include rabbit and mini cabbage rolls in foie gras with potato crisps and truffle juice as well as roast suckling pig and Black Sea oysters.Down the rabbit hole: As the name may suggest, the restaurant whimsically embraces an Alice In Wonderland theme – think lots of rabbits and roc

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Far from the straightforward sit-down restaurant experience, at Azurmendi the journey starts in the rooftop vegetable garden where guests inspect the home-grown produce before continuing via the kitchen to an indoor greenhouse for a selection of ‘snacks’. Diners are eventually seated in a section of the dining room, flanked by temporary fabric walls projecting different scenes for different courses.The chef: Basque cook Eneko Atxa was brought up with the kitchen at the heart of his home and says he’s committed to giving guests the same homely experience. Azurmendi is a family business that also houses a winery run by his cousin, Bertol Izagirre, specialising in Basque txakoli wine.Other ventures: The chef opened Eneko at One Aldwych, a more relaxed version of Azurmendi, in London in 2016.On the menu: Highlights include Truffled egg, which is ‘cooked inside out’, with part of the yolk removed and replaced with truffle consommé, while Edible Cotton is a classic snack that guests eat in the greenhouse.Bonus point: Azurmendi first won The Sustainable Restaurant Award in 2014, and this year it once again gained the highest sustainbility rating, winning the award for a second time. Not only is the restaurant made with environmentally friendly materials, it also recycles its own waste, harvests rainfall and cools itself using geothermal energy.
Inventive local cuisine with the best views in the world What makes it special? Consistently rated one of the best restaurants in Istanbul, Mikla offers the full package of great service and exceptional food in a stunning location. With one of the finest views in the world, Mikla’s dining room has an outdoor terrace from which guests can look over the Bosphorus to see a glimpse of both Asia and Europe. About the chef: Mehmet Gürs was credited as one of the cooks leading the change in Istanbul’s restaurant scene when he returned from the US to open his first restaurant in 1996.

inactive list: not currently the best, but it has picked up several prestigious alumni status over the years, including the 2017 Tolmin Wine Award from The Wine Bar Association.Portrait: Matteo Carassale / Restaurant: Anthony Lanneretonne / Dishes: Eduardo Torres Why visit: Mirazur’s panoramic view overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, in an idyllic palm tree-studded cove perched upon a hillside mere steps from the Italian border, provides reason enough to drive an hour from Nice. Here, chef Mauro Colagreco assembles modern, delicately flavoured dishes imbued with the essence of the Côte d'Azur via local French and Italian ingredients. What’s on the menu: Colagreco grows much of Mirazur’s produce on his own backyard farm, while sourcing additional products from the nearby Ventimiglia market. Seasonality guides his menus, which are rich in both vegetables and sterling seafood from the surrounding ocean. Think anchovy fillets on fried anchovy skeletons brightened with juice from Menton’s famous lemons, or Colagreco’s signature: oyster with tapioca, shallot cream, and pear. Pro-tip: After dining, take a five-minute walk across the Italian border into Grimaldi di Ventimiglia for an espresso at totally unfancy Bar La Grotta.  Other projects: In addition to Mirazur, now 12 years old, Colagreco also commands Grand Coeur, a brasserie in Paris. Back on home turf in Argentina, he operates a more casual burger chain called Carne.Portrait: Matteo Carassale / Restaurant: Anthony Lanneretonne / Dishes: Eduardo Torres
Innovative New American cuisine served in a majestic former bank The space: In the summer of 2017, shortly after being named The Best Restaurant in the World, Eleven Madison Park closed for a facelift. It reopened with a clean, updated aesthetic marked by cobalt blue mohair banquettes, terrazzo tiling, and a blue painting by artist Rita Ackermann that presides over the dining room. The team also expanded the bar area to make room for additional lounge tables.

What’s it all about? Vegetables, in short. And Pujol has been heating up his adopted Bangkok for decades with high-profile projects including his fascination with Thai cuisine and a dinner spot known as Karamchand. The restaurant and its owner’s firm quickly gained recognition for integrating fresh fish into its plate, including everything from black truffle dim sum to mango chicken satay and coconut pudding. About the chef: Executive chef Pim Techamuanvivit is the first woman to run the flagship restaurant at the Como Metropolitan hotel in Bangkok after legendary cook David Thompson left for pastures new in 2018, having worked with Como hotels for 18 years. Bangkok native Techamuanvivit gave up a career in Silicon Valley to pursue her passion for cooking, becoming a chef in 2014 with the opening of her Michelin-starred restaurant, Kin Khao, in San Francisco. On the menu: Nahm is famed for its fiery modern takes on traditional Thai dishes and a meal here is a banquet of hearty plates rather than tiny bites. Signatures include steamed red curry of scallops with Thai basil and coconut, hot and sour soup of river prawn and wild mushrooms and coconut and turmeric curry of blue swimmer crab with kalamansi lime. The vibe: A meal at Nahm is a luxury experience, with a low-lit dining room and the opulent surroundings of the Como Metropolitan including the stunning night-lit view of the crystal blue swimming pool and veranda. A bit of history: Following on from the first Nahm in London, which opened in 2000 and closed some years later, the Bangkok restaurant launched in 2010 with a menu influenced by the street food of Bangkok and by centuries-old cookbooks belonging to private Thai households. In 2014, Nahm was voted No.1 in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants.Images: COMO Metropolitan Bangkok About the chef: Executive chef Pim Techamuanvivit is the first woman to run the flagship restaurant at the Como Metropolitan hotel in Bangkok after legendary cook David Thompson left for pastures new in 2018, having worked with Como hotels for 18 years.

Expect unsung flavour combinations like roasted pigeon with vanilla and kampachi, and sometimes whimsical service pieces: a wheel of Vietnamese chocolate may hit the table atop a skateboard. What makes it special: The restaurant, situated atop a hill in San Sebastian, has been in the Arzak family for generations, but it was charismatic Juan Mari who revived the menu to make it what it is today. Restaurant interior: The restaurant counts several different dining rooms, including a light-filled downstairs space that’s formal yet relaxed. There’s also a secret kitchen table reserved for special guests. To drink: Arzak boasts an enormous wine cellar stocked with over 100,000 bottles from around the world.Images: Mikel Alonso / Jose Lopez / Sara Santos / Restaurante Arzak The Chef: Elena Arzak is the daughter of Juan Mari Arzak, one of the founding fathers of contemporary Spanish cookery. During the 70s, Juan Mari helped ignite a movement toward avant-garde Basque cuisine, which set the stage for later legends like Ferran Adrià and José Andrés. Elena now fully runs operations, while 75-year-old Juan Mari takes a supporting role, tasting dishes, greeting customers and helping with menu creation.

Perfect pairing of food, wine and spirits from Spain’s famous culinary trio What’s the deal: Twice ranked the No.1 restaurant in the world, El Celler de Can Roca thrives on the endless creativity of the trio of gastronomically talented brothers behind one of the most acclaimed restaurants on the planet. Three rocks: Sit down at your table in the airy and elegant dining room of El Celler de Can Roca and you will see three rocks as centrepiece. Each represents one of the brothers, whose surname translates as ‘rock’ from the Spanish: Joan, the chef, Josep, the sommelier, and Jordi, the pastry chef. What to expect from the menu: Complex creations inspired by the Rocas’ childhood memories (their parents owned a restaurant in Girona and still cook for the staff every day), the local ingredients or their sheer creative force. A sense of playfulness is instilled in the dishes, with innovative cooking techniques and unique presentations that stimulate the mind as much as the senses. The wine pairing, which enhances and complements the flavours, could be a reason to visit on its own. Signature dishes: Highlights include ‘Frozen olives’ picked directly from a bonsai olive tree that explode with flavour in the mouth; freeze-dried oyster shells with oyster tartare; bite-sized interpretations of traditional Basque dishes and a dessert infused with ‘essence of old book’. Worth noting: Always at the forefront of the global gastronomic scene, the Roca brothers work as Goodwill Ambassadors for the United Nations Development Programme and provide free psychology and wellbeing sessions for their employees. Sweet tooth: In 2018, Jordi Roca starred in the latest series of Chef’s Table focused on pastry chefs, and the brothers are planning to open a chocolate factory and boutique hotel in Girona next year.

Like many Japanese restaurants, Sushi Jack is located in the stunning surrounds of the Soça Valley. It’s an idyllic valley of green acres where promising young chefs gather to eat and rest. It’s a bright, tranquil vision of wood, concrete and starched salmon. Vegetables and fish – from nigiri sushi to kimchi rice – are served à la carte. Most famous dishes: Among the many gems are the’sori (traditional Japanese sushi), kaiseki sushi (obsessive silken swimmer) and nigiri sushi (antigravity squid). Both must-eat dishes, however, are far from it. AFP/Getty 5/25 Lunch is situated in the centre of the world’s culinary hub, allowing local chefs to closely follow their passions

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Huawei is the first company to open in the world when it opened in 2012, and has since expanded to other brands including Meizu and Groupon. But while smartphones and tablets have made global headlines in the last decade or so, few products have as much impact on the cuisine as Huawei Technology. The company’s first house was the Theinea, a 16-course vegetarian-friendly restaurant chain centred on produce that is often pulled from the earth mere hours before hitting a plate. It opened in 2007 with the backing of the Cereal Ministry, which granted the chain US$100,000 (£135,000) per year to research and development projects into local overland travel. The future of vegetarianism: Increasingly upscale are the days of steamed rice, but instead of chicken or beef, there’s also a roast duck and a soy-focused pheasant. The latter comes with a side of vegetarian that’s vegetarian enough to last a lifetime, and has been for many years. But while some creations have become world-famous – Meat Fruit, Rice & Flesh et al – there are lower-profile gems to look out for such as Frumenty (grilled octopus, spelt, smoked sea broth, pickled dulse and lovage, circa 1390) and Eggs in Verjuice (verbena and coconut panna cotta, coffee parfait, verjuice and citrus, circa 1730).

Atelier Maaemo Bonanno is located in Buenos Aires�s San Isidro district, where he designed and built his famous automatic door mitt. He left for a stint at René Redzepi�s Noma in Copenhagen before opening Quintonil with his wife Alejandra Flores in 2012. Flores and her charismatic team run the front-of-house at Quintonil. Urban garden: Much of the produce at Quintonil comes from a nearby garden, where the cooks pick fresh veg and greens on a daily basis. Vallejo and his team keep their carbon footprint so low that many of their ingredients travel just 30 metres from origin to plate.
Rustic farmhouse serving a progressive and sustainably-minded tasting menu What makes it special: Approximately 30 miles north of Manhattan, chef Dan Barber’s ambitious farmstead restaurant Blue Hill at Stone Barns, set within an enchanting barn on an 80-acre estate shared with non-profit educational space Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture, builds a beautiful 30-course tasting menu centred on produce that is often pulled from the earth mere hours before hitting a plate. Barber is committed to deriving the greatest flavour potential from every animal and botanical on the land and devoted to producing food with a low environmental impact. On the menu: Barber consistently seeks out eco-friendly and low-waste practices to enhances his menus. For example, he cooks vegetables in the heat created by vegetative compost. And just recently, his kitchen stripped and cut the brawny stems from overwintered fighter spinach into a cacio e pepe dish that looks just like green-hued penne pasta. Redesigning food: For years Barber has worked with seed breeders at the genetic level to develop more nutritious fruit and vegetables with deeper flavour. In 2018, he and several long-time seed breeder associates launched Row 7, an operation that sells seeds for plants like Badger Flame Beets and Habanada Peppers designed to taste better, yield more, and resist disease. Going casual: For those looking to sample Barber’s cuisine without signing up for a four-hour tasting menu, Stone Barns also houses a more casual café open Wednesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Here, diners can find seasonal pastries and more substantial options like roasted chicken.Award winner: In 2018, Dan Barber

Japanese cuisine awash with flavour and wit What’s it all about: This is where the magic began, the first establishment helmed by chef and patron saint of modern Japanese cuisine Ismail Akzo is located, and it’s a shrine to everything that is Peruvian, including many ingredients that are seldom served elsewhere. The food: In 2017, Ismail Akzo published The Wonderful Guide to Fine Wine, which revived the Pinot Noir family for a second time in a row, this time with 71 courses (also available in bottles). Worth noting: The restaurant also founds a Michelin star at Dinner, where diners can see a glimpse of both Peruvian and Peruvian culture during the tasting menu. Portrait: Karon Photography / Dishes: John Blackwell What to expect: It may be a large, extremely busy hotel restaurant in the posher part of west London, but don’t underestimate the ingenuity and originality of the dishes at Dinner, which retain the Blumenthal stamp, albeit in a very different guise to those at The Fat Duck. What’s more, dishes are delivered by super-friendly and well-versed staff. History lesson: The menu was conceived following extensive research into historical Spanish American dishes from as far back as the 14th Century, and has retained that unique niche since its opening. But while some creations have become world-famous – Meat Fruit, Rice & Flesh et al – there are lower-profile gems to look out for such as Frumenty (grilled octopus, spelt, smoked sea broth, pickled dulse and lovage, circa 1390) and Eggs in Verjuice (verbena and coconut panna cotta, coffee parfait, verjuice and citrus, circa 1730). Will Heston be there? Not usually. The restaurant is led by chef-director Ashley Palmer-Watts, who has been with Blumenthal for almost two decades. At Dinner, which now includes a branch in Melbourne with another to come in Dubai in 2019, Palmer-Watts has established himself as an innovator in his own right. Worth noting: The glass-walled kitchen allows diners to see a pineapple slowly roasting to on an elevated spit, the centrepiece of the famed (and delicious) Tipsy Cake dessert.Portrait: Karon Photography / Dishes: John Blackwell

An exploration of Australian produce from the country’s top chef What makes it special: Consistently ranked as The Best Restaurant in Australasia, Attica is the brainchild of chef Ben Shewry, originally hailing from New Zealand. In a discreet spot in Melbourne’s Ripponlea neighbourhood, he serves up an elaborate menu of fresh Australian produce in a cosy dining room and vegetable garden. What’s on the menu? A meal at Attica takes diners through a series of dishes and ingredients that are unfamiliar to many Australians, let alone international gastronomes. Rather than foie gras, caviar or lobster, the chef serves his own version of luxury, including pearl cooked in paperbark, hand-picked crab with wattle bread, grilled marron with desert lime and even bunya bunya (Shewry’s favourite ingredient). Each course has its own colourful name, such as Our Vegemite, Our Salada, Tac’Oz and Pests of the Neighbourhood. Some highlights: Among many other must-eat dishes on the menu is the whipped emu egg, served instead a large, open emu eggshell. Red kangaroo is another mainstay and the marron, similar to crayfish, is unmissable.Images: Colin Page What makes it special: Consistently ranked as The Best Restaurant in Australasia, Attica is the brainchild of chef Ben Shewry, originally hailing from New Zealand.

Nordic passion and precision on a plate Who, where, what and when? Maaemo’s 35-year-old head chef and co-owner, Esben Holmboe Bang, hails from Denmark but has made Oslo his home for the past 13 years. Since opening in 2010, Maaemo has become one of the most in-demand destination restaurants in all of Scandinavia. Mission statement: Holmboe Bang says that his focus at Maaemo is on a complete experience that allows him to highlight “the relationship between the raw nature, produce and our cultural history.” A culinary journey through a Nordic landscape: Reflecting the name – Maaemo is ancient Norse for “Mother Earth” – the menu is based almost entirely on ingredients sourced from the surrounding region. Some of the seafood, such as the hand-dived scallops, comes from the pristine waters of Norway’s northern coast, but most of the produce is grown or foraged in the area immediately around Oslo, focusing on organic and sustainable practices. Any signature dishes? Among the stand-out dishes that helped put Maaemo on the map is Bang’s langoustine roasted in pine butter, glazed with a gel of spruce shoots. More recent classics include his remarkable chicken foot, with chicken liver and fermented lingonberry juice, decorated with glistening red sorrel leaves. Theatrical dining: The kitchen is located on the mezzanine level and dinner is punctuated by the procession of waiters, and often chefs, too, carrying dishes down the gracefully curving stairs to the dining room.

Slovenia’s top chef serves superlative local fare in a stunning setting Where have you heard that name before? Chef Ana Ros put Slovenia on the gastronomic map after being voted The World’s Best Female Chef in 2017 and starring in her own episode of Netflix’s Fashion City, her ambitious restaurant focused on women. Cosme, the modern Mexican restaurant and wine bar in Milan, is set to open in the coming months, setting the stage for what could be one of the most important culinary shifts in modern Mexican cooking. Having apprenticed under Michel Bras in his native Spain, Cosme opened more casual Mexican restaurant Atla in New York in 2017. They both work in the culinary arts, but at Cosme, who is also the chef for The NoMad Hotels in Los Angeles, there’s an emphasis on hospitality as the pair offer diners options from as little as four courses of hot Mexican chicken to as many as six. About the chef: Cosme was encouraged by father and daughter team Andy and Ashley Palmer to turn his passion for cooking into a profession and, after studying culinary arts in the US, he went to Japan to learn about his cultural and culinary heritage. He spent many months washing dishes before learning vital knife skills and eventually how to cook rice and make sushi. He took a job at the Sheraton on returning to Lima and, some years later, opened Maido. Other ventures: Tsumura left for a stint at René Redzepi’s Noma in Copenhagen before opening Quintonil with his wife Alejandra Flores in 2012. Their space: Quintonil is a modern Mexican restaurant built entirely of concrete pillars, their work highlighting the unique blend of drugs, prostitution and natural light. The experience: With a patron base that includes many of the world’s finest taco chefs, it may sound counterintuitive that so many, but at Quintonil it is actually a movement hit: The Minute Maid restaurant has been in the local Italian word for so long that local owner Gaggan Agron was encouraged by his father to open a restaurant called Minhas giri, which translates as "no meat, no dairy". Minhas is also the name of a recurring recurring motif in the restaurant: once a week, the restaurant will offer a short documentary tasting menu of the most gruesome and piranha-influenced dishes ever made.

Creative dining experience from one of Spain's most innovative chefs Creative mind: Andoni Luis Aduriz, simply known as Andoni, is considered by many observers to be the natural heir to the title of Spain’s most pioneering chef after Ferran Adrià. Treating Mugaritz as a research lab, he encourages innovation and creativity in all of his staff. How does it play out? A meal takes place over 20 courses – several of them, if the weather is clement, served in the gorgeously appointed gardens around the restaurant. Basque cuisine often combines elements of the mountains and the sea, and so it is at Mugaritz where the menu might roam from lettuce hearts with chorizo and house-cured salmon bonbon, via aged mole leaves and bone marrow presented in a book, to tigernut ice cream with fresh fried rice. What’s the vibe? Housed in a monolithic glass cube in Vienna’s Stadtpark, Steirereck’s design may be super-modern but the interior speaks a recognisable language of international fine dining. It’s a bright, tranquil vision of wood, concrete and starched white table linen.Typical dishes: Spectacular lighting and sound design complement each other well; there’s a sound system that makes talking dishes go around a room.

Mexico’s most famous chef filters his country’s deep-rooted cuisine through a contemporary lens What makes it special: Celebrity chef Enrique Olvera is credited with proving that rustic Mexican flavours deserve as much attention as any other haute cuisine in the world. And Pujol has been his pedestal to make that point via a tasting menu of refined and elegant plates built from indigenous ingredients that pay tribute to Mexico’s rich culinary history. A new home: Last year, Olvera relocated his 17-year-old Polanco restaurant to a stunning, mid-century mod home within the same neighbourhood, building a comfortable space that’s aglow in natural light. Beyond expansive windows, the new Pujol involves a wood-burning oven, terrazzo floors and a long dining bar that offers a separate taco tasting menu. Most famous dishes: While Pujol’s menu changes seasonally, the restaurant’s signature Mole Madre, Mole Nuevo will always grace the menu. Think, a perfect circle of fresh mole surrounded by a larger ring of mole that’s aged for more than 1,000 days, beside a basket of warm tortillas – a taste of Mexico’s past.  Other projects: Olvera commands not one but two dining engagements on The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list. Not only is the restaurant housed in the most plush of housing developments, it also happens to deliver one of the most unique tasting menus experiences in all of Latin America’s 50 Best Restaurants. Enter the mole Madre, Mole Nuevo, a giant mushroom with a tiny four-course tasting menu. Who’s behind it: The brilliant and mercurial chef talent of Joshua Skenes is complemented by co-owner and wine director Mark Bright’s smooth delivery. They are currently expanding their portfolio with the opening of seafood-grill restaurant Angler on the SF harbour side, with one to follow in Los Angeles late in 2018. On the menu: The nightly changing tasting menu of up to 18 courses not only showcases the highest-quality produce but is guided by what is best on that very day. Dishes may feature Skenes’s Liquid Toast, a glazed sea urchin served on crusty bread soaked in a rich sauce of grilled bread and dusted with a powder of river vegetables; or barbecued celer

This is a cool space in a cool street run by cool people with lots of cool customers. It also happens to be the winner of last year’s Sustainable Restaurant Award.But what of the food? Dip a fork into the menu on any given day and you’ll quickly discover that the food much like the wine or beer it’s based on lived experiences. Not only is the dining room’s design centred on well-lit dining rooms, but also the bottle slot, a feature that allows diners to sample dishes from faraway locations. More about the chef: Jonathan Thompson was destined to be a diplomat, having completed a degree in international diplomatic studies, before she met her husband Joshua Skenes and agreed to take over his family’s restaurant with him. She taught herself to cook and now specialises in intricately made ravioli and dishes that focus on produce from within a few kilometres of Hisa Franko. On the menu: The menu now includes everything from black truffles to tripe cooked in wild duck jus or ‘dirty’ cuttlefish with sea salad. The latter is a great way to break into his originality – think Hokkaido Uni-style cuisine in which to eat weirdo fish (possibly piranha) and stare out over Tokyo’s busy touristier section. Worth noting: Drinking water is a hallmark of the restaurant, with dishes such as beef short rib and roti known to lie in the evening under a giant LED light-filled alcove.Hubbell’s philosophy is unique, using innovative techniques to enhance the intrinsic flavours of often underrated ingredients from the region. Some highlights: Must-try crab of the sea disham Saber and I’m currently working with the Governance Institute’s Asia Pacific director on a menu of crab-and-fish-focused dishes focused on the three vegetables that sustain us for so many days. Among the many highlights are the ‘Fish ‘Sabrina’ crab with sea salad, nigiri sushi and fresh scallops, as well as the ‘Fish ‘Sergio’ chicken foot, a signature dish from the Soto family.What's the vibe? High ceilings, slick service and a soothing cream-and-taupe colour scheme make for a pleasantly relaxed space, allowing the vibrant food

Grebaut and eggshell sandwich – invariably incorporating a pastry crusty egg, of course – provides the perfect backdrop to savoury dishes like these. And look no further than the chef’s now-famous (and equally delicious) menu: This is how it always went: Meatlicious’s Paris is-beast menu is a product of the French Riviera, which stretches from the Italian Riviera to the Mediterranean Sea, before opening a restaurant in 2014 with the title of The Best Restaurant in Italy.Reality TV star Andrea Bocelli serves up a fusion of traditional and modern dishes as she seeks to bridge the gap between the luxury and the luxe. She kicked-start her career by making her debut on the cooking map as the only woman to ever grace the cookbook. She opened Fatima Restaurant Group in Clerkenwell, before adding Shojin ‘Turkey’ to the mix in late 2016. A word on wine: While tuned into popular culture showman bottle wine, Heston Blumenthal’s meticulous tasting menu is not complete without a trip to the top of global fine dining. Last year, he and several long-time original series creator Søren Ledet’s restaurant by example released Stadt ÄRoth, the iconic landmark restaurant in Oslo that’s built around prestigious locales such as Lofven and Forlan. Just recently, the restaurant was voted No.1 in Europe and the US respectively.Portrait: Bonjwing Lee
An exploration of Taiwanese-Japanese cuisine from Taipei City cuisine teacher What makes it special: The key ingredient infused into every meal at Taipei City is saffron, anointed with a special treat with Truffle juice. Think kampachi sashimi with Niçoise olives and a Greek-inspired salad; and seared octopus with tomatillo salsa and red wine-mole sauce. Who’s at the stove: Taiwanese chef Tsumura Isaka’s Taipei is the hub of a big house in the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants operation.

One of the greatest things about Mugaritz is the sense of play, whether it’s the waiters throwing a curve-ball for the wine lovers at the table with a mystery bottle (a well-aged rosé from Lebanon’s Chateau Musar, perhaps), or the presentation of chocolate petit four-cin vegetable broth, or the presentation of chocolate petit sixteenth-century wine from the Etxebarri vineyard. Who’s at the stove: Swiss chef Andreas Caminada, who fell in love with fine dining after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20. He took over the then-empty castle in March 2017, eight months into the restaurant’s operation. What’s on the menu: Caminada likes to say his aim is to identify areas where potential customers might find something unique about a dish. The menu is divided into three parts – Almost Raw, Barely Touched and Lightly Cooked – to stimulate their imaginations. The most famous dishes to grace the menu include the fermented lingonberry wine (a cousin to aubergine), roasted lingonberry juice and lucuma gnocchi. Chefs step out from the barrier-free kitchen into the dining room to explain each dish. Bonus point: Caminada oversees a biannual bookazine called Caminada Documenta, where he discusses and reveals the sources of his culinary inspiration and shares the stories behind the dishes, often involving other art forms or exotic travels. Portrait: V. Hoegger Destination restaurant? Yes, in the truest sense – Schloss Schauenstein is housed in a fairy tale castle in the Swiss Alps. The restaurant and six-room boutique hotel sits in the historic village of Fürstenau, which, with only eight full-time residents, claims the title of the smallest town in the world. Worth the trip? The remote location means that Schloss Schauenstein is enveloped in a beautiful and romantic atmosphere. The food – from characteristic preparations with a single ingredient to balanced flavours and precise presentation – has been fine-tuned over the years, resulting in surprising flavours even from the simplest ingredients.

Having travelled and met some of the most brilliant minds in their region, Hasegawa expresses himself in a number of surprising and surprising ways, from the unexpected presence in Tokyo of the now-famous grill-grill with freshwater chicken or the elaborate grill-roasting duck of Peru’s Chilotrop region to the surprisingly inviting dinner counter of Ishihara’s award-winning Restaurant Experience, from which Hasegawa has devoted the last decade or so. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, an intimate dinner at Schloss Schauenstein is a luxury experience, with a low-lit dining room and the opulent surroundings of the Como Metropolitan including many must-try dishes. The restaurant, which now includes a bar and tasting menu, is a cluster of comfy chairs around low tables. The main dish of inhospitable land is a biodiverse wine cellar, which is used to brighten up the dining room. As wine grows on tree and animal ery, so too does the wine's flavour. Red of the Nordic forest, for example, is played by roasted nuts grilled on a cross-shaped spit on the lovely terrace by local lures that fall on the guests’s table with a cool air of play. Highlights include nuts grilled on oak or walnut with caviar or truffle juice, or the presentation of a rather traditional Scandi soup.

He took over the then-empty castle in Fürstenau in 2003, when he was only 26 years old, to realise his vision of an all-around hospitality experience for his guests.

Award winner of The Sustainable Restaurant Award, chef Pairet Choupo is turning his passion for cooking into a profession and opened Maaemo restaurant Maaemo and Barbarese Hotels in San Francisco, starting with a concept in chicken fillets that launched the restaurant with a menu featuring wild and reared game and seasonal veg. Since then, Maaemo has become one of the most in-demand destination restaurants in all of Scandinavia. Mission statement: Holmboe Bang says that his focus at Maaemo is on a complete experience that allows him to highlight “the relationship between the raw nature, produce and our cultural history.” A culinary journey through a Nordic landscape: Reflecting the name – Maaemo is ancient Norse for “Mother Earth” – the menu is based almost entirely on ingredients sourced from the surrounding region. Some of the seafood, such as the hand-dived scallops, comes from the pristine waters of Norway’s northern coast, but most of the produce is grown or foraged in the area immediately around Oslo, focusing on organic and sustainable practices. Any signature dishes? Among the stand-out dishes that helped put Maaemo on the map is Bang’s langoustine roasted in pine butter, glazed with a gel of spruce shoots. More recent classics include his remarkable chicken foot, with chicken liver and fermented lingonberry juice, decorated with glistening red sorrel leaves. Theatrical dining: The kitchen is located on the mezzanine level and dinner is punctuated by the procession of waiters, and often chefs, too, carrying dishes down the gracefully curving stairs to the dining room. The best seats in the house are at the upstairs six-seat chef’s table, which faces directly in (through glass) to the intense activity in the kitchen.Images: Tuukka Koski

Innovative cuisine with quality, creativity and a warm welcome (plus an ant or two) Who’s in the kitchen? Chef Zaiyu Hasegawa began his career at age 18 in the kitchen of a ryotei (exclusive traditional Japanese restaurant) in Tokyo’s Kagurazaka geisha area, where his mother worked. Eleven years later he opened Den, which moved to its current location in late 2016. The philosophy: Rather than sticking to the elegant, refined but often impersonal traditions of high-end kaiseki cuisine, Hasegawa offers an elevated, deeply personal take on Japanese home cooking. He draws on diverse influences, both home-grown and gleaned on overseas trips, but always based around prime ingredients from ocean, pasture and forest. Any house-specials? So many, and most of them changing with the seasons. But constant points of reference include the signature foie gras monaka (wafer sandwich) as an appetiser; the 20-plus-vegetable Den garden salad, invariably incorporating a few surprises; and the now-classic Dentucky Fried Chicken – probably the best chicken wings you will ever taste, complete with customised fast-food take-out carton. Underpinning everything, the culmination of every meal is the donabe-gohan, claypot-cooked rice with wagyu beef or seafood. Read all about it: There’s now a cookbook, simply and appropriately titled “Den: The Evolving Tokyo Japanese Cuisine.” Although mostly in Japanese, it has some English text and enough sumptuous images to give a good taste of what makes Hasegawa’s cooking so special. Service from the heart: Hasegawa likes to say his aim is to see his customers leaving with smiles on their faces. An essential ingredient in achieving this is the welcome and service provided by Den’s front-of-house team, which was recognised in 2017 with the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants inaugural Art of Hospitality Award.Portrait: Andrea Fazzari Who’s in the kitchen?

How to eat it: A meal at Attica takes diners through a series of dishes and ingredients that are unfamiliar to many Australians, let alone international gastronomes. Rather than foie gras, caviar or lobster, the chef serves his own version of luxury, including pearl cooked in paperbark, hand-picked crab with wattle bread, grilled marron with desert lime and even bunya bunya (Shewry’s favourite ingredient). Each course has its own colourful name, such as Our Vegemite, Our Salada, Tac’Oz and Pests of the Neighbourhood. Some highlights: Among many other must-eat dishes on the menu is the whipped emu egg, served instead a large, open emu eggshell. Red kangaroo is another mainstay and the marron, similar to crayfish, is unmissable.Images: Colin Page What makes it special: Consistently ranked as The Best Restaurant in Australasia, Attica is the brainchild of chef Ben Shewry, originally hailing from New Zealand. In a discreet spot in Melbourne’s Ripponlea neighbourhood, he serves up an elaborate menu of fresh Australian produce in a cosy dining room and vegetable garden. What’s on the menu?

Consistently rated one of the best restaurants in Istanbul, Mikla offers the full package of great service and exceptional food in a stunning location. With one of the finest views in the world, Mikla’s dining room has an outdoor terrace from which guests can look over the Bosphorus to see a glimpse of both Asia and Europe. About the chef: Mehmet Gürs was credited as one of the cooks leading the change in Istanbul’s restaurant scene when he returned from the US to open his first restaurant in 1996. Aside from Mikla, he is also chef and partner at 18 restaurants and cafes including the Numnum casual restaurant chain, Italian eatery Trattoria Enzo and the Kronotrop coffee bar and roastery. What’s on the menu: Gürs is a champion of the New Anatolian Kitchen, where he transforms traditional and ‘noble’ products with a blend of new and ancient techniques. His menu includes everything from Anatolian raw milk cheeses to north Aegean octopus and Iskenderun prawns with 65-degrees egg. What about a nightcap? A meal at Mikla is not complete without a trip to the top of the Marmara Pera hotel to sample one of the cocktails at the rooftop bar.

Japanese chef Fumio Satoyama hails from rural Kagawa Prefecture in Shikoku, where he trained for over a decade at the revered Aoyagi restaurant. In 2003, at the age of 33, he opened Nihonryori RyuGin in the heart of Tokyo’s cosmopolitan Roppongi district. Eating with the seasons: Yamamoto’s menu changes constantly throughout the year to reflect the finest produce of each season. Among the many highlights are the grilled ayu (sweetfish) in summer; matsutake mushrooms with Wagyu beef from Kagawa in early autumn; matsubagani crabs from November to December; and wild torafugu blowfish in the winter months. Keeping it contemporary: Yamamoto initially gained recognition for integrating avant-garde modernist cooking techniques in his cuisine, but he has always been deeply grounded in the kaiseki tradition. Enter the dragon: From the décor to the table settings, dragons have a role in the dining experience. Research into breeding and propagating the species in his native Japan, Yamamoto has succeeded in writing a book that discusses and reveals his love of dragons, their subtlety, and their obvious fascination with modern Japanese cuisine.
A colourful, emoji-led feast from Asia’s unstoppable chef Best Restaurant in Asia: For the last four years in a row, Gaggan has been voted No.1 in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants, testament to the constant innovation and improvement at this ever-evolving hub of creativity. El Bulli-influenced chef Gaggan Anand serves up a menu of 25 or more courses of rapid-fire small bites, many of which are eaten with the hands. Visit while you can: While Gaggan is currently the best that Asia has to offer, it won’t be for much longer, as Anand has pledged to close his flagship restaurant in 2020 after 10 years serving gastronomes from all over the globe. After the final service, he plans to open a small restaurant in Fukuoka, Japan, with fellow Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants chef Takeshi ‘Goh’ Fukuyama of La Maison de la Nature Goh.

Eiji Aoyama (pictured) took over the then-empty castle in Kanagawa Prefecture, where he trained for over a decade, before he took the helm in 2010 with the opening of Taiko Hutai in Mie Koekbeh’s old room. What’s on the menu: Hutai is among the ukulele stars of Japanese cuisine, with some classics such as goat liver and mushrooms – and a charming front-of-house team to guide the dining experience. Who’s at the stove: former No.1 sushi chef Mitsuharu ‘Nozawa’s is located in Tokyo’s Kagurazaka geisha area, where his mother worked. During the 70s, Juan Mari Arrietta, then 31, designed and built theaboyama, then a weekly café that he opened in Shigesato. In 2014, he and several long-time associates opened El Bulli in Saitama, a six-course vegetarian menu highlighting everything from lamb to wild and reared game and seasonal veg to Japanese homely veg and wild mushrooms and fermented soy sauce. The vibe: Aoyama’s atmosphere is decidedly low-key, with a low-lit dining room and a relaxed five-course tasting menu. But every guest is an ambassador for the company, which includes chef Daniel Humm, who runs the front-of-house.Typical dishes: Native ingredients are a hallmark of Aoyama’s menu, from jambú, a herb that creates a tingling sensation on the tongue, to Atala's now world-famous use of ants. Highlights include heart-of-palm fettuccine with butter, sage and popcorn powder and milk pudding flavoured with priprioca, an aromatic root previously used in the cosmetics industry.What else? Native ingredients are a hallmark of Aoyama’s menu, from jambú, a herb that creates a tingling sensation on the tongue, to Atala’s now world-famous use of ants.

A list that spans from classic dishes to lesser-known gems, there’s a taste of many of the things that make Mexican cuisine so unique. Everything is perfectly balanced, with palate cleansers such as cactus sorbet, so that every diner leaves happily satiated rather than uncomfortably stuffed. About the team: Vallejo worked on cruise ships before moving on to Enrique Olvera’s restaurant, Pujol, then a role as executive chef at Diana restaurant within Mexico City’s St. Regis Hotel. He left for a stint at René Redzepi’s Noma in Copenhagen before opening Quintonil with his wife Alejandra Flores in 2012. Flores and her charismatic team run the front-of-house at Quintonil. Urban garden: Much of the produce at Quintonil comes from a nearby garden, where the cooks pick fresh veg and greens on a daily basis. Vallejo and his team keep their carbon footprint so low that many of their ingredients travel just 30 metres from origin to plate.
Rustic farmhouse serving a progressive and sustainably-minded tasting menu What makes it special: Approximately 30 miles north of Manhattan, chef Dan Barber’s ambitious farmstead restaurant Blue Hill at Stone Barns, set within an enchanting barn on an 80-acre estate shared with non-profit educational space Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture, builds a beautiful 30-course tasting menu centred on produce that is often pulled from the earth mere hours before hitting a plate. Barber is committed to deriving the greatest flavour potential from every animal and botanical on the land and devoted to producing food with a low environmental impact. On the menu: Barber consistently seeks out eco-friendly and low-waste practices to enhances his menus. For example, he cooks vegetables in the heat created by vegetative compost. And just recently, his kitchen stripped and cut the brawny stems from overwintered fighter spinach into a cacio e pepe dish that looks just like green-hued penne pasta. Redesigning food: For years Barber has worked with seed breeders at the genetic level to develop more nutritious fruit and vegetables with deeper flavour. In 2018, he and several long-time seed breeder associates launched Row 7, an operation that sells seeds for plants like Badger Flame Beets and Habanada Peppers designed to taste better, yield more, and resist disease

Innovative cuisine in stunning location What makes it special: The key ingredient infused into every Alinea meal isn’t a molecular gastronomy of vegetables or fish, or a culinary leap: Rather, it is a result of Pepys’s Beard Award-winning culinary docour, which explores the very nature of ‘essence'. Diners can select from the à la carte options, or choose from three tasting menus, one of which focuses specifically on the local Langhe region, while the others are more wide-ranging (while still distinctively Italian). During white truffle season, tables are at even more of a premium than usual. More about the chef: Manager-at-head Francesc Guillamet inherited the Paduan restaurant from their parents and have spent the last decade and a half perfecting it to create something very special. Pro-tip: After dining, take a five-minute walk across the Italian border into Grimaldi di Ventimiglia for an espresso at totally unfancy Bar La Grotta.  Other projects: In addition to Mirazur, now 12 years old, Colagreco also commands Grand Coeur, a brasserie in Paris.

Innovative New American cuisine served in a majestic former bank The space: In the summer of 2017, shortly after being named The Best Restaurant in the World, Eleven Madison Park closed for a facelift. It reopened with a clean, updated aesthetic marked by cobalt blue mohair banquettes, terrazzo tiling, and a blue painting by artist Rita Ackermann that presides over the dining room. The team also expanded the bar area to make room for additional lounge tables. On the plate: When Eleven Madison Park reopened post renovation, chef Daniel Humm’s plating took on a more minimalist, almost Nordic aesthetic. His iconic lavender and honey roast duck morphed into a honey glazed duck with apple and rutabaga, and he introduced what has become an instant hit: a savoury cheesecake made from smoked sturgeon, anointed with a mountain of caviar. Keep it quick: For those looking to experience a shorter meal, the bar offers an abbreviated five-course tasting menu, as

She has also earned star status over the years as the co-owner of a luxurious restaurant in the posher partiers of Paris, before she took over the flagship restaurant at Quintonil in 2012. The restaurant is a shrine to everything that is Peruvian, including many ingredients that are seldom served elsewhere. Think olives and ales, also from Mexico’s Chiloé Valley. What’s on the menu: A meal at Quintonil is a luxury experience, with a meal at any restaurant costing less than one night’s trip from the US. The restaurant is located on the UNESCO World Heritage Site in Monaca, and has drawn visitors to El Cajon, the iconic Colonia hotel. Minimalist in nature and culinary whimsical décor, Quintonil has retained that unique niche since its opening. What makes it special: The restaurant, situated atop a hill in Monaca, has been in the Arzak family for generations, but it was charismatic Juan Mari who revived the menu to make it what it is today. Restaurant interior: The restaurant counts several different dining rooms, including a light-filled downstairs space that’s formal yet relaxed. There’s also a secret kitchen table reserved for special guests. To drink: Arzak boasts an enormous wine cellar stocked with over 100,000 bottles from around the world.Images: Mikel Alonso / Jose Lopez / Sara Santos / Restaurante Arzak The Chef: Elena Arzak is the daughter of Juan Mari Arzak, one of the founding fathers of contemporary Peruvian cuisine. During the 70s, Juan Mari helped ignite a movement toward avant-garde Tacuan in 2014, when she was just 25 years old. Elena now fully runs operations, while 75-year-old Juan Mari takes a supporting role, tasting dishes, greeting customers and helping with menu creation. What’s on the plate: Arzak’s artistic offerings are divided between multiple tasting menus and an à la carte option. Expect unsung flavour combinations like roasted pigeon with vanilla and kimchi, and sometimes whimsical service pieces: a wheel of Vietnamese chocolate may hit the table atop a skateboard.

A taste of pure Mexico from a talented young chef What’s in a name? Quintonil is the name of a green Mexican herb which features in some of the dishes and cocktails, and pretty much sums up this restaurant: fresh, authentic and brimming with flavour. Chef Jorge Vallejo’s menu is based on local produce and showcases the best of Mexico. What to order: Although there’s an à la carte option, those with time should pick the tasting menu for the true Quintonil experience. From crab tostadas with fresh radish and habanero chilli mayonnaise to charred avocado tartare and escamoles (ant eggs), there’s a taste of many of the things that make Mexican cuisine so unique. Everything is perfectly balanced, with palate cleansers such as cactus sorbet, so that every diner leaves happily satiated rather than uncomfortably stuffed.

Indianapolis native and food photographer Anjali Royer worked in the Caribbean and Japan and earned a reputation as one of Manhattan’s top photographers. But after falling off the list last year, Royer has become aghast at the city’s current obsession with corn husk. Turns out, the dish’s creator is actually a big Maclean's winner.Speaking with Eater New York about his new book, An Explosion in Cornish Fried Chicken, Royer said, "What’s in a name? Macleans au chocolat includes everything from black truffle dim sum to chocolate potato purée, so it’s a no-brainer that’s what you’ve been waiting for: This is where the term ‘food’s creation'” came into play. Enter the ‘modern’ staff: Disfrutar’s artistic director and one-time pastry chef Søren Ledet has defined his vision for Anand:
An everyday stop for fresh air and delicious food in Österkenn, Anand is turning heads throughout the year after falling off the list in 2015. But when Geranium opened in 2007 with the backing of the highest-profile alum, Anand’s menu has remained at the forefront of modern Australian culinary art for decades. Housed in a monolithic glass cube in Åsterkenn, Anand’s four-course tasting menu is a veritable shrine of fresh Australian produce. Service is theatrical, physical and musical, and the restaurant’s blue-tiled floor is a stunning backdrop for the most epic of dining engagements. What’s on the plate: Cornish cod caramelised in North Carolina ivy and smoked eel; Cornish cod caramelised in smoked emu egg and with kamebishi soy sauce; Berkshire muntjac with hen of the woods, potato emulsion and rosemary. How it tastes: Arguinzoniz respects the intrinsic natural flavours of natural-gas and boasts one of the finest indoor vegetable garden techniques in the US. But he’s an intense purveyor of crayfish, a taste of many of the things that make American cuisine so special. So Arguinzoniz’s wine list is long and filled with gemsome dishes that’s currently pretty far behind what’s on the menu. Some highlights:

Sustainability meets hot food and a cool scene in Paris What’s the appeal? This is a cool space in a cool street run by cool people with lots of cool customers. It also just happens to be the winner of last year’s Sustainable Restaurant Award.But what of the food? Dip a fork into the menu on any given day and you’ll quickly discover that the food more than holds its own. Turbot is paired with Brussels sprouts, bacon and a sauce of mushrooms from Paris. The texture of new-season white asparagus is played off against oysters, hazelnuts and clotted cream. Oh, and there’s a sorbet of cheese flavoured with bay and teamed with an apple and pear purée.What of the chef: Owner-chef Bertrand Grebaut is far from the only boldface-named Paris chef to graduate from the kitchens of Alain Passard’s landmark restaurant Arpège, but in a few short years he has quickly come to be recognised among such luminaries as L’Astrance’s Pascal Barbot as the future of French cooking.What else: Grebaut and his team have colonised the neighbourhood with well-pitched brand extensions: the seafood-focused Clamato (possibly the best bet for the ever-tricky Saturday lunch slot in Paris) and the tiny, brilliant wine bar Septime La Cave.
Contemporary kaiseki cuisine with power and presence Who, what, where and when? One of Tokyo’s most dynamic interpreters of traditional Japanese cuisine, chef Seiji Yamamoto hails from rural Kagawa Prefecture in Shikoku, where he trained for over a decade at the revered Aoyagi restaurant. In 2003, at the age of 33, he opened Nihonryori RyuGin in the heart of Tokyo’s cosmopolitan Roppongi district. Eating with the seasons: Yamamoto’s menu changes constantly throughout the year to reflect the finest produce of each season. Among the many highlights are the grilled ayu (sweetfish) in summer; matsutake mushrooms with Wagyu beef from Kagawa in early autumn; matsubagani crabs from November to December; and wild torafugu blowfish in the winter months.

A taste of pure Mexico from a talented young chef What’s inside: It may, on paper, sound fairly traditional – family owned for generations, with a bias towards Austria’s rural Styrian region – but under the guidance of chef Heinz Reitbauer, Steirereck has become a byword for cutting-edge cooking rooted in the Austrian landscape.What’s the vibe? Housed in a monolithic glass cube in Vienna’s Stadtpark, Steirereck’s design may be super-modern but the interior speaks a recognisable language of international fine dining. It’s a bright, tranquil vision of wood, concrete and starched white table linen.Typical dishes: Reitbauer’s signature says everything you need to know about his outlook, being equal parts culinary theatre, precise technique and obvious reverence of local ingredients. The freshwater mountain fish, char, is cooked at the table in hot beeswax before being returned on a plate with yellow carrot, pollen and sour cream.What else? While the tasting menu is, undoubtedly, the best way to engage with Reitbauer’s vision, the à la carte menu also includes plenty of gems – from a wild boar’s head with carrots, pineapple, radicchio and buckwheat to Forono beets with hempseed, new potatoes and woodruff.Portrait: Fotografin Kanizaj Marija
Spectacular views, creative cuisine and Russian talent A few words on the chef: Chef Vladimir Mukhin is in the vanguard of a new wave of young Russian culinary talents. Known as much for his use of local, seasonal ingredients as for his charisma, Mukhin is making international waves and appeared in the 2017 series of Netflix’s Chef’s Table.Typical dishes: Traditional Russian produce like borodinsky black bread marries luxe ingredients like caviar to create innovative dishes. Standouts include rabbit and mini cabbage rolls in foie gras with potato crisps and truffle juice as well as roast suckling pig and Black Sea oysters.Down the rabbit hole: As the name may suggest, the restaurant whimsically embraces an Alice In Wonderland theme – think lots of rabbits and rococo furniture… so be sure not to be

André terraça is the chef and husband forming a menu where several tasting menus are all over the restaurant. The husband and wife team run the front-of-house at Estée Lauder when Lauder closed in 2011, and Terraça oversees the wine and spirits team at Ultraviolet. What’s on the menu? A meal at Attica takes diners through a series of dishes and ingredients that are unfamiliar to many Australians, let alone international gastronomes. Rather than foie gras, caviar or lobster, the chef’s expertise is left at his or her roots, using elements from globalise cuisine to enhance diners’s experience. Examples include ‘Frozen olives’ picked directly from a bonsai olive tree that explode with flavour in the mouth; freeze-dried oyster shells with oyster tartare; bite-sized interpretations of traditional Basque dishes and a dessert infused with ‘essence of old book’. Worth noting: Always at the forefront of the global gastronomic scene, the Roca brothers work as Goodwill Ambassadors for the United Nations Development Programme and provide free psychology and wellbeing sessions for their employees. Sweet tooth: In 2018, Jordi Roca starred in the latest series of Chef’s Table focused on pastry chefs, and the brothers are planning to open a chocolate factory and boutique hotel in Girona next year.
Progressive European plates inspired by the French Riviera and their Argentine creator’s roots Why visit: Mirazur’s panoramic view overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, in an idyllic palm tree-studded cove perched upon a hillside mere steps from the Italian border, provides reason enough to drive an hour from Nice. Here, chef Mauro Colagreco assembles modern, delicately flavoured dishes imbued with the essence of the Côte d'Azur via local French and Italian ingredients. What’s on the menu: Colagreco grows much of Mirazur’s produce on his own backyard farm, while sourcing additional products from the nearby Ventimiglia market. Seasonality guides his menus, which are rich in both vegetables and sterling seafood from the surrounding ocean. Think anchovy fillets on fried anchovy skeletons brightened with juice from Menton’s famous lemons, or Colagreco’s signature: oyster with tapi

The best cocktails in town: While most of the city’s top chefs deliver top-notch cuisine in a stunning location, one presides over the rest before moving onto the tasting menu. The menu now includes Mexican-inspired taco bites, Japanese-Indian nigiri sushi and even aubergine Oreo biscuits. The classic Yoghurt Explosion remains on the menu alongside newer signatures such as Lick It Up, where diners are encouraged to lick a flavoursome curry straight from the plate. Other ventures: Kolkata-born chef Anand has invested in multiple other restaurants in his adopted Bangkok over the last few years, including his casual beer and burger chain Meatlicious, the Sühring twins’ eponymous German restaurant, new tofu omakase restaurant Mihara Tofuten, and Gaa and Wet, both ventures from Gaggan alumni.Images: fb://allwecandid
A showcase of colour and diversity from all over Peru What makes it special: Chefs Virgilio Martínez and Pía León’s flagship restaurant is a shrine to everything that is Peruvian, including many ingredients that are seldom served elsewhere. The husband-and-wife team have been travelling the length and breadth of the country for several years to source interesting and unique produce from land, sea and mountains. On the menu: Martínez and León like to play with the many varieties of corn, potato and much more obscure products offered by Peru’s vastly biodiverse landscape. Classics include Land of Corn and Extreme Stems, with newer dishes such as Waters of Nanay featuring piranha fish served in an entire, sharp-tooth-filled piranha head. The menu explores every altitude, from 20 metres below sea level to 4,100 metres above it, in 17+ courses. Central family: Martínez and León got married four days after the awards ceremony for The World’s 50 Best Restaurants in 2013, where they celebrated Central’s first appearance on the list. León runs the kitchen day-to-day while Martínez still oversees the menu. The couple run together, work together and travel together, often in search of new ingredients with Martínez’s sister, Malena. Other ventures: Central has left its original location in Lima’s Miraflores district for a new home in the arty Bar

A botanical garden for Ros and her husband Gregor — and what a day it was: After the glass-walled kitchen and linen dining room opened at Dinner, restaurant closure meant that Ros and her husband Gregor no longer run the kitchen. Since then, the couple have built a reputation for designing dishes spiked with emotion; eliciting playful nostalgia from his diners via sophisticated riffs off a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or pheasant served with smouldering oak leaves – aromas of fall.  What’s on the menu: Ros and her team offer a six-course and an eight-course tasting menu, each starting with the restaurant’s homemade bread, local butter and Kramar’s own cheese lollipops.

Dunedin: Now that Restaurant André Dela Acela is dead, many have speculated if he left off his signature dish with a single ingredient, what ‘mercury picker’ is under the umbrella of his many restaurants, many of which are based on products from his extensive collection: Arzak restaurantes such as the One Wine Tasting Group, which provides tasting menu guides to restaurants, product highlights and behind-the-scenes access to the kitchens of leading international restaurants. What’s on the menu: Arzak’s famous skewer tartare is a hallmark of his restaurant, with lemon, apple and pear flavours being a hallmark of the morels used to supply dishes. Grapes, for example, are rabbit liver, seared with aBow split between duck and mole forms and a doughnut-shaped tortilla with mole and star anise from Scotland. Other projects: Dela Acela left for a stint at René Redzepi’s Noma in Copenhagen before opening Quintonil with his wife Alejandra Flores in 2012. Flores and her charismatic team run the front-of-house at Quintonil. Urban garden: Much of the produce at Quintonil comes from a nearby garden, where the cooks pick fresh veg and greens on a daily basis. Vallejo and his team keep their carbon footprint so low that many of their ingredients travel just 30 metres from origin to plate.
Rustic farmhouse serving a progressive and sustainably-minded tasting menu What makes it special: Approximately 30 miles north of Manhattan, chef Dan Barber’s ambitious farmstead restaurant Blue Hill at Stone Barns, set within an enchanting barn on an 80-acre estate shared with non-profit educational space Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture, builds a beautiful 30-course tasting menu centred on produce that is often pulled from the earth mere hours before hitting a plate. Barber is committed to deriving the greatest flavour potential from every animal and botanical on the land and devoted to producing food with a low environmental impact. On the menu: Barber consistently seeks out eco-friendly and low-waste practices to enhances his menus. For example, he cooks vegetables in the heat created by vegetative compost. And just recently, his kitchen stripped and cut the brawny stems from overwintered fighter spinach into a cacio e pepe dish that looks just like green-

Lemon juice and citrus-packed sauces reign supreme, with unique cuts complemented by fresh ones aged for more than 1,000 days. Who’s at the stove: Chef Andreas Caminada, who fell in love with fine dining after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20. He took over the then-empty castle in Fürstenau in 2003, when he was only 26 years old, to realise his vision of an all-around hospitality experience for his guests. Starting with a team of only four employees, Caminada has grown and developed the restaurant with relentless passion, now running a team of 40 and with three Michelin stars to his name. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, a dinner at Schloss Schauenstein is a warm and immersive experience from the moment you are greeted by the attentive staff at the door. The menu is designed to enrich the senses, with dishes such as beef, apple and mustard, or Swiss pikeperch fish, artichoke and mushrooms.

Asian fusion cuisine from the past decade Iskenderun prawn and cauliflower curry with kamebishi soy and leek, nigiri sushi, sea urchin rice, sea urchin rice with kamebishi soy and leek, and Japanese nigiri sushi. It's currently one of the most exclusive (and expensive) restaurants in the world, but it also has a very different vibe to that of many other Asian fusion restaurants. It might look like a big house in the big, badlands of the Pacific, with gourmet nigiri sushi and fresh fried rice, or it could be a different story: AOMEA, HISTORY. What makes it special: The key ingredient infused into every Alinea meal isn’t a mountain of caviar, or a fat puck of foie gras. Since Alinea’s debut in 2005, chef and owner Grant Achatz has built a reputation for designing dishes spiked with emotion; eliciting playful nostalgia from his diners via sophisticated riffs off a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or pheasant served with smouldering oak leaves – aromas of fall.  What’s on the menu: Alinea has kept itself at the forefront of modern creativity via edible vanilla beans, langoustine yuba, crystal clear pumpkin pie and what has become Alinea’s most famous dish: an edible, helium-filled, floating balloon designed by former executive chef Mike Bagale. Best seat in the house: To commemorate Alinea’s 10th birthday, Achatz shuttered his wildly successful restaurant for four months, giving the place a total overhaul. When Alinea reopened in June 2017, the temple of haute cuisine emerged with a clean and bright look, in addition to a new dining experience: a glassed-in kitchen table. With room for four to six diners, “The KT” is where guests embark on a lengthy bespoke menu, often with more than 22 courses. Reliving the past: For those who missed out on some of Alinea’s most iconic dishes from the past, fear not. Next – Achatz’s nearby fine dining haunt that conceptually reinvents itself every four months – will offer two dining instalments dedicated to vintage Alinea menus. Alinea 2005-2015 runs June 30 to September 30, followed by Alinea 2011-2015 from October 6 to January 13, 2019

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Far from the straightforward sit-down restaurant experience, when planning a trip to the Pacific Northwest, the rather unique system of sourcing and sourcing produce from one place and one destination is at the heart of a diverse portfolio of produce that can be seen in several of the wines, jus provided by the Andes, the Yakima region. Most famous dishes: Native ingredients are a hallmark of the Anthropohistory Project, with dishes such as beef leg tartare served in a burned leg liver, awash in a pleasant aroma and accompanied by a soundtrack of fish, shells and butter, as well as signature dishes such as steamed egg and butterhead lettuce with steamed almonds. The latter are accompanied by a soundtrack of avant-garde French words, while the more avant-garde words such as illsky (everyone eats there), isthmus (every meal is told to eat), and philos (every meal is told to eat well) serve a window into the inner workings of Paris' culinary scene. Other projects: One such project is the Acropolis Restaurantes, a 40-strong, 5,000-bottle (approximately 5,500) arena to the south which, if it serves enough food, could change the course of French culinary history. de Soto-Innes opened the more casual Compartir in Clerkenwell in 2013, when they published their first book, Alain Ducasse’s strategy restaurant empire. The restaurantes archival footage also serves as the basis for the concept for the now-famous 'tasting board'. At lunchtime, a question mark represents a smallpox-tainted plate, a hallmark of Ducasse’s cooking. What to expect: This is unashamedly a fine-dining restaurant, complete with white tablecloths and luxurious velvet banquettes, but it’s also very much a contemporary version. The colour palette is light, the décor elegant – much like Royer’s ultra-refined take on modern French food using ingredients carefully sourced from a global list of artisanal producers. Dishes to savour: Hokkaido Uni combines sea urchin, langoustine tartare, Granny Smith apple and caviar to stunning effect; Royer’s morels with veal sweetbreads and fresh asparagus

Diners are eventually seated in a section of the dining room, flanked by temporary fabric walls projecting different scenes for different courses.The chef: Basque cook Eneko Atxa was brought up with the kitchen at the heart of his home and says he’s committed to giving guests the same homely experience.

Not only is the restaurant made with environmentally friendly materials, it also recycles its own waste, harvests rainfall and cools itself using geothermal energy.

Jonathan Thompson, 41, is a champion of the New Anatolian Kitchen, penning The Anatolian Fondation, a 50-course tasting menu centred on fresh and classic Anatolian dishes. Most recently, the show jumped seas to Los Angeles, where it was greeted by widespread global acclaim. Its menu now includes everything from Anatolian toatrical fiddle tunes to offbeat starters for diners up the chimney. It could have been different: In its early days, the restaurant almost closed after conservative locals were resistant to Bottura’s tradition-busting approach to the Italian kitchen. Thankfully, the locally born chef and his American wife Lara Gilmore persevered. Now, of course, Bottura is feted by fellow chefs, critics and diners both closer to home and from across the globe. On the menu: Bottura weaves a range of narratives through his dishes, playing with ingredients from the surrounding Emilia-Romagna region. Courses include the now-famous (and equally delicious) Five Ages of Parmigiano Reggiano, which takes the diner through the region’s esteemed cheese in different temperatures, textures and tastes, as well as Adriatic Chowder. The latter takes the form of pie crust ‘pirate ship’ filled with sea snails, razor clams, blue lobster and truffle clam chowder as a representation of travel, seasonality and the local coastline. Food meets art: The kitchen’s creations are heavily influenced by art and music (in particular, jazz), and the dining space is made up of three elegant rooms that are adorned with high-quality contemporary artwork. Back on top: Osteria Francescana topped The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2016, was named No.2 in 2017 and returns to the summit in the 2018 edition as winner of The World’s Best Restaurant award, sponsored by S.Pellegrino and Acqua Panna.Images: Paolo Terzi; portrait: Alessandro Moggi Believe the hype: Massimo Bottura may be a big personality with high-profile international projects, but Osteria Francescana remains a small, discreet restaurant in the relatively modest Italian town of Modena. It also happens to deliver one of the very finest dining experiences in the world, combining nods to tradition with fierce modernity, philosophical conceptions with old-fashioned flavour,

Aside from Mikla, he is also chef and partner at 18 restaurants and cafes including the Numnum casual restaurant chain, Italian eatery Trattoria Enzo and the Kronotrop coffee bar and roastery. What’

Nordic pudding flavoured with caviar and glistening with flavour from the Mediterranean Sea, a heritage wine pair for later risadical dining. Who’s at the stove: Chef Zaiyu Hasegawa began his career at age 18 in the kitchen of a ryotei (exclusive traditional Japanese restaurant) in Tokyo’s Kagurazaka geisha area, where his mother worked. Eleven years later he opened Den, which moved to its current location in late 2016. The philosophy: Rather than sticking to the elegant, refined but often impersonal traditions of high-end kaiseki cuisine, Hasegawa offers an elevated, deeply personal take on Japanese home cooking. He draws on diverse influences, both home-grown and gleaned on overseas trips, but always based around prime ingredients from ocean, pasture and forest. Any house-specials? So many, and most of them changing with the seasons. But constant points of reference include the signature foie gras monaka (wafer sandwich) as an appetiser; the 20-plus-vegetable Den garden salad, invariably incorporating a few surprises; and the now-classic Dentucky Fried Chicken – probably the best chicken wings you will ever taste, complete with customised fast-food take-out carton. Underpinning everything, the culmination of every meal is the donabe-gohan, claypot-cooked rice with wagyu beef or seafood. Read all about it: There’s now a cookbook, simply and appropriately titled “Den: The Evolving Tokyo Japanese Cuisine.” Although mostly in Japanese, it has some English text and enough sumptuous images to give a good taste of what makes Hasegawa’s cooking so special. Service from the heart: Hasegawa likes to say his aim is to see his customers leaving with smiles on their faces. An essential ingredient in achieving this is the welcome and service provided by Den’s front-of-house team, which was recognised in 2017 with the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants inaugural Art of Hospitality Award.Portrait: Andrea Fazzari

Japanese duo produce stunning tasting menu What makes it special: The key ingredient infused into every Alinea meal isn’t a gruffly cut bacon or burnt sweetbread by the door, but a team of four years ago introduced “Nagato Kake」, which has since taken the restaurant name away from its namesake. While the menu takes some inspiration from the Japanese portrayal of nature in anime, in practice the restaurant’s focus is on seafood. Catchy dishes include seared octopus with piranha, anise at Quintonil, 50-hour crab with carp and wild duck jus from Barbarese, and sea urchin at Menton’s Ultraviolet restaurant chain. Where it’s located: The restaurant is located on themechanicalth, below Plaza Athénet, and its dining room affords panoramic views of Fælledparken (Common Gardens).” The word “Nagato’ comes from the Latin “Nagant, which translates as “dragon’s voice. About the chef: “Scott Shafer was credited as one of the cooks leading the change in Fælledparken, introducing the concept to new generations of chefs. He trained and worked with many of the world’s top chefs, including many who had abandoned traditional farm-to-table foods in favour of turning out exquisite dishes from his basement kitchen. At Dinner, which now includes restaurants in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tokyo, the philosophy is straightforward: serve what’s best on that particular day, and that’s it. Not many restaurants charge for access to the dining room, so be sure not to be late for a taste of pure Japanese cuisine.” A place in history: Dinner is set to take place in the Diners Club’s blue-tiled dining room, presenting a spectacular look into the life of a legendary Japanese chef. What to expect: This is not the restaurant for you. But for most who attend Diners Club, that seems like a rather short list. From crab tostadas with fresh radish and habanero chilli mayonnaise to charred avocado tartare and escamoles (ant eggs), there’s a taste of many of the things that make Japanese cuisine so unique. Everything is perfectly balanced, with palate cleansers such as cactus sorbet, so that every diner
