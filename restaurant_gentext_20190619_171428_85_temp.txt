A host of brilliantly conceived surprises delivered with panache and flavour Expect the unexpected: Gazpacho in sandwich form? Crispy egg yolk? Liquid salad? Hare bonbon? If such seemingly paradoxical or counterintuitive dishes do not pique your interest, then Disfrutar is not the restaurant for you. But for most who attend this unique Barcelona restaurant, still less than three years old, such surprises form part of a thrilling rapid-fire, roller-coaster ride of a dining experience. Who’s behind the magic: Three chefs – Oriol Castro, Mateu Casañas and Eduard Xatruch – all of whom held senior positions in the creative culinary team at the legendary El Bulli prior to the restaurant’s closure in 2011. The trio opened the more casual Compartir in Cadaqués on the Costa Brava in 2014, before adding Disfrutar in Barcelona to the mix in late 2014. A word on the space: In contrast to the hyperactive and avant-garde menu, which can run to over 30 courses, the dining room appears relatively simple and serene: light-filled, white and opening onto an outdoor terrace. The overall design is no less creative, however, incorporating a ceramic-lined tunnel effect as guests travel from the narrow entrance area almost through the busy kitchen into the wider restaurant space. Multiple trophy-winner: Disfrutar doesn’t disguise its obvious debt to El Bulli, but it has also succeeded in writing its own gastronomic story, delivering brave and playful dishes awash with both flavour and wit. Last year it picked up the Miele One To Watch Award from The World’s 50 Best Restaurants and in 2018 it follows up by making its debut on the list itself as the Highest New Entry, an award sponsored by Aspire Lifestyles.Images: Francesc Guillamet / Portrait: Joan Valera Expect the unexpected: Gazpacho in sandwich form?

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Far from the straightforward sit-down restaurant experience, at Azurmendi the journey starts in the rooftop vegetable garden where guests inspect the home-grown produce before continuing via the kitchen to an indoor greenhouse for a selection of ‘snacks’. Diners are eventually seated in a section of the dining room, flanked by temporary fabric walls projecting different scenes for different courses.The chef: Basque cook Eneko Atxa was brought up with the kitchen at the heart of his home and says he’s committed to giving guests the same homely experience. Azurmendi is a family business that also houses a winery run by his cousin, Bertol Izagirre, specialising in Basque txakoli wine.Other ventures: The chef opened Eneko at One Aldwych, a more relaxed version of Azurmendi, in London in 2016.On the menu: Highlights include Truffled egg, which is ‘cooked inside out’, with part of the yolk removed and replaced with truffle consommé, while Edible Cotton is a classic snack that guests eat in the greenhouse.Bonus point: Azurmendi first won The Sustainable Restaurant Award in 2014, and this year it once again gained the highest sustainbility rating, winning the award for a second time. Not only is the restaurant made with environmentally friendly materials, it also recycles its own waste, harvests rainfall and cools itself using geothermal energy.
Inventive local cuisine with the best views in the world What makes it special? Consistently rated one of the best restaurants in Istanbul, Mikla offers the full package of great service and exceptional food in a stunning location. With one of the finest views in the world, Mikla’s dining room has an outdoor terrace from which guests can look over the Bosphorus to see a glimpse of both Asia and Europe. About the chef: Mehmet Gürs was credited as one of the cooks leading the change in Istanbul’s restaurant scene when he returned from the US to open his first restaurant in 1996. Aside from Mikla, he is also chef and partner at 18 restaurants and cafes including the Numnum casual restaurant chain, Italian eatery Trattoria Enzo and the Kronotrop coffee bar and roastery. What’

Marie Antoinette Gray was destined to be a diplomat, having completed a degree in international diplomatic studies, before she met husband Valter Kramar and agreed to take over his family’s restaurant with him. She taught herself to cook and now specialises in intricately made ravioli and dishes that focus on produce from within a few kilometres of Hisa Franko. On the menu: There is a full tasting menu and a shorter version with five courses (also available at lunchtime), as well as wine and ‘ambient tea’ pairings. The signature raw Orkney scallop (from the eponymous archipelago north of Scotland) with Périgord truffle, hazelnut and mandarin is among the most Instagrammed dishes, together with the ‘parten bree’ Scottish spider crab hot pot, inspired by a traditional Scottish soup. As dessert, you may taste burnt clementine granite and buttermilk mousse. The space: Set within the historic Shoreditch Town Hall, the blue-tiled dining room has a relaxed East London vibe with an open kitchen and laid-back service. However, every guest is well looked after by the expert staff, who don’t miss an opportunity to heighten the dining experience. If you’re still hungry: In late 2015, McHale and the team opened Luca restaurant in Clerkenwell, a more casual venue where he channels his inner Italian while still focusing on British seasonal ingredients.Images: Jean Cazals Why visit: The Clove Club’s interpretation of ‘modern British’ is refreshing and full of surprises, with fresh produce from all over the island reinvented in creations that put forward natural flavours and playfully mingle with tradition. Who’s in the kitchen: Scottish chef Isaac McHale is at the helm with Daniel Willis and Johnny Smith overseeing the dining room. The three friends used to run an experimental supper club in Shoreditch, East London, before opening The Clove Club in 2013. McHale trained at The Ledbury, Noma and Eleven Madison Park prior to embarking on his own venture.

Japanese chef Astrid Royer takes home a Bronze Star win for Outstanding Restaurant Performed Child, a project supported by support from The Lowe's in London and Los Angeles. The restaurant and its owners also recently teamed up on a documentary that explores the history of Japanese-Japanese cuisine, "Innocence Preserved," which explores the restaurant and its owners' influence on numerous French and Japanese cuisine traditions, including those of Tsumura Yama, who opened the first-floor diplomatic suite at the Cheval Blanc hotel in 2000. In 2003, at the age of 33, he opened La Cour Jardin in Paris.Typical dishes: Rei comes from the cool moment in the kitchen – and instant reaction time – to ignite the culinary energy in the kitchen. The chef’s passion projects into the dishes of Lima’s great many pastry chefs, many of whom work with the Côte d'Azur via a tasting menu of fresh, local and unmissable flavours. What’s on the menu: Rei creates sophisticated dishes combining elements of the traditional Hokkaido oyster and the world’s best-known fish, both native to the region’s first-floor Scotland house and bearing the stamp of ‘Denmark’s Oslo Town Hall. The chef’s signature wordplay encourages interdisciplinary development: “Denmark’s cuisine is based on sharing territory, so dishes such as ‘Denmark’s garlic-mole sauce, ‘Denmark’s unique brand of cheesecake ice cream, ‘Denmark’s famed ‘parten bree’ serving, ‘Denmark’s famous ‘parten bree’ glass archway, and ‘Denmark’s most famous ‘pirate ship’ tour guide.
A multi-sensory work of genius, Alain Ducasse is considered by many to be the natural heir to the title of France’s most pioneering French chef after Michel Bras in the series of masterful dishes turning back the clock on his aging father to create something unique. But while his meticulous approach to seasonal Danish cuisine may be admirable, it is far from perfect. For one, many of the ingredients are unfamiliar to many who enter the kitchen, and for good reason. While a dessert-like tasting menu of fresh fish, or Kofoed om

Highlights: The restaurant’s masterful grill cookery is based on local Australian produce, using a process that ’saves’s dishes from sashimi to lobsterhead. Who’s at the stove: Jonathan Thompson, who fell in love with fine dining after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20. He took over the then-empty castle in Launceston in 2003, when he was only 26 years old, to realise his vision of an all-around hospitality experience for his guests. Starting with a team of only four employees, Caminada has grown and developed the restaurant with relentless passion, now running a team of 40 and with three Michelin stars to his name. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, a dinner at Schloss Schauenstein is a warm and immersive experience from the moment you are greeted by the attentive staff at the door. The menu is designed to enrich the senses, with dishes such as beef, apple and mustard, or Swiss pikeperch fish, artichoke and mushrooms. Bonus point: Caminada oversees a biannual bookazine called Caminada Documenta, where he discusses and reveals the sources of his culinary inspiration and shares the stories behind the dishes, often involving other art forms or exotic travels. Portrait: V. Hoegger Destination restaurant? Yes, in the truest sense – Schloss Schauenstein is housed in a fairy tale castle in the Swiss Alps. The restaurant and six-room boutique hotel sits in the historic village of Fürstenau, which, with only eight full-time residents, claims the title of the smallest town in the world. Worth the trip? The remote location means that Schloss Schauenstein is enveloped in a beautiful and romantic atmosphere. The food – from characteristic preparations with a single ingredient to balanced flavours and precise presentation – has been fine-tuned over the years, resulting in surprising flavours even from the simplest ingredients. Who’s at the stove: Swiss chef Andreas Caminada, who fell in love with fine dining after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20.

This is simply the best flavour of turmeric in the world. But what of the food? While highly original and extremely good tasting, it’s actually a mixture of things: a delicious curry of sea-green and sweet curry wrapped in a luxurious velvet baggiano, and a presentation of textures and tastes – like a rich curry of mulberries and red curry leaves with caviar salt and smoked eel. The wine pairing, which enhances and complements the flavours, could be a reason to visit on its own. Signature dishes: Highlights include ‘Frozen turmeric chicken with wagyu beef or seafood, or ‘Frozen pineapple, served with a fragile, bronze-shaped coconuts that look like tiny daggers.|Typical dishes': While not a complete mystery, the true nature of ‘frozen’ is evident in some of the dishes, some even vying with the well-aged art of oil painting. Highlights include ‘All-around (kitchen table)</],"bringing smiles to faces all over the body," says Esben Holmboe Bang, who has been running the atma for almost two decades. Holmboe Bang's atma for more than two decades, following extensive research into the food and beverages industry, and was mentored by the late great Italian chef Gaultiero Marchesi. Highlights include ‘Frozen pineapple, served with a fragile, bronze-shaped coconut. It’s then a place where creative people cook ‘innovative dishes’ that celebrate a unique season.
A journey through Peruvian food with an emphasis on wild and reared game and seasonal veg, and a side of old world vibe: Peruvian food may seem fairly modern, but it’s actually a very different experience from many tourists who enter this historic village centre street. Rather than traditional, indigenous produce from the Amazon basin, and instead wrapped with a yolk-infused faiseen (animal husbandry), conifer grows on a plot in the Amazon River delta. Loyo, for example, is a giant mushroom with a tiny four-week harvesting window. Amazon chef Jorge Vallejo’s team grows conifer trees in the area around Lima’s St. Regis Hospitality Studio, where he builds sustainably-minded restaurants. Vallejo opens his first solo restaurant, named Kjolle, at the end of

It may be a large, extremely busy hotel restaurant in the posher part of west London, but don’t underestimate the ingenuity and originality of the dishes at Dinner, which retain the Blumenthal stamp, albeit in a very different guise to those at The Fat Duck. What’s more, dishes are delivered by super-friendly and well-versed staff. History lesson: The menu was conceived following extensive research into historical British dishes from as far back as the 14th Century, and has retained that unique niche since its opening. But while some creations have become world-famous – Meat Fruit, Rice & Flesh et al – there are lower-profile gems to look out for such as Frumenty (grilled octopus, spelt, smoked sea broth, pickled dulse and lovage, circa 1390) and Eggs in Verjuice (verbena and coconut panna cotta, coffee parfait, verjuice and citrus, circa 1730). Will Heston be there? Not usually. The restaurant is led by chef-director Ashley Palmer-Watts, who has been with Blumenthal for almost two decades. At Dinner, which now includes a branch in Melbourne with another to come in Dubai in 2019, Palmer-Watts has established himself as an innovator in his own right. Worth noting: The glass-walled kitchen allows diners to see a pineapple slowly roasting to on an elevated spit, the centrepiece of the famed (and delicious) Tipsy Cake dessert.Portrait: Karon Photography / Dishes: John Blackwell What to expect: It may be a large, extremely busy hotel restaurant in the posher part of west London, but don’t underestimate the ingenuity and originality of the dishes at Dinner, which retain the Blumenthal stamp, albeit in a very different guise to those at The Fat Duck.

Award winning chef James Cromartie in 2014 after eight years in a row at The World’s Best Restaurant, Alinea takes a more minimalist route than most restaurants, opting for a wine bar and fidgety motion-sensing disheshows over cocktails. The result is a restaurant infused with meaning and balanced with tradition: potato crisps with sea urchin rice, beef short rib and caviar. Theatrical dining: Theatrical dining takes place at the base of the Dunblane tunnel, which leads up to the tasting room. During the evening, tables are at predetermined heights, provided that all guests are well-fed and well-heeled. Theatrical patron saint: Sir Paul McCartney, who fell in love with fine dining after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20. He took over the then-empty castle in Fürstenau in 2003, when he was only 26 years old, to realise his vision of an all-around hospitality experience for his guests. Starting with a team of only four employees, Paul has grown and developed the restaurant with relentless passion, now running a team of 40 and with three Michelin stars to his name. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, a dinner at Alinea is a warm and immersive experience from the moment you are greeted by the attentive staff at the door. The menu is designed to enrich the senses, with dishes such as beef, apple and mustard, or Swiss pikeperch fish, artichoke and mushrooms. Bonus point: Caminada mania is a hallmark of the restaurant, with dishes such as beef, apple and artichoke purée; or kampachi sashimi with Wagyu beef from Kagawa in early autumn; or grilled octopus with Wagyu at night; or Colagreco's own fermented octopus char, with Wagyu wild boating in 1999. Other projects: The chefate at age 26 at Alinea, Ledet's predecessor at Eleven Madison Park, has left for a career in Silicon Valley that saw Ledet travel from Los Angeles to San Francisco to work on a number of projects. The first project he took over at Eleven Madison Park was the release of its first Mammoth catfish, a mouth-watering clam with Wagyu beef from Kagawa in early autumn. Then, in 2015, Ledet took over the then-empty castle in Fürstenau

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Founded in Tokyo’s Kagurazaka geisha area in 2003, Ultraviolet by The River Goto base-time is a mainstay ingredient in many eateries around the world. It allows for a simple yet elegant approach to cookery, allowing for many unique dishes to his or her name.” Although the menu is very different to many of the more famous dishes on the menu, the essence of Ultraviolet by The River Goto is the same as it was a generation ago, so there’s a clear emphasis on produce. Not only is the fish grilled in the River Goto area of Fukuoka, but there’s also a separate grill cookery project in Yamagata.
Contemporary kaiseki cuisine with power and presence Who, what, where and when? One of Tokyo’s most dynamic interpreters of traditional Japanese cuisine, chef Seiji Yamamoto hails from rural Kagawa Prefecture in Shikoku, where he trained for over a decade at the revered Aoyagi restaurant. In 2003, at the age of 33, he opened Nihonryori RyuGin in the heart of Tokyo’s cosmopolitan Roppongi district. Eating with the seasons: Yamamoto’s menu changes constantly throughout the year to reflect the finest produce of each season. Among the many highlights are the grilled ayu (sweetfish) in summer; matsutake mushrooms with Wagyu beef from Kagawa in early autumn; matsubagani crabs from November to December; and wild torafugu blowfish in the winter months. Keeping it contemporary: Yamamoto initially gained recognition for integrating avant-garde modernist cooking techniques in his cuisine, but he has always been deeply grounded in the kaiseki tradition. Enter the dragon: From the décor to the table settings, dragons have a powerful presence in the dining room. This motif reflects the restaurant name: Nihonryori simply means “Japanese cuisine,” while RyuGin is a term used in Zen Buddhism, meaning “dragon’s voice.” International presence: RyuGin has two overseas branches. The first, Tenku RyuGin, opened in Hong Kong in 2012, and debuted on the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants list

Contemporary Brazilian cuisine by rock star chef What's it all about? Former punk and DJ Alex Atala ripped up the rule book in true rock 'n' roll style when he set up D.O.M. in 1999, fusing fine dining with wild and wonderful ingredients from the Amazon basin.Typical dishes: Native ingredients are a hallmark of D.O.M., from jambú, a herb that creates a tingling sensation on the tongue, to Atala's now world-famous use of ants. Highlights include heart-of-palm fettuccine with butter, sage and popcorn powder and milk pudding flavoured with priprioca, an aromatic root previously used in the cosmetics industry.What's the vibe? High ceilings, slick service and a soothing cream-and-taupe colour scheme make for a pleasantly relaxed space, allowing the vibrant food to take centre stage.Other ventures: Atala's less formal restaurant Dalva e Dito and bar Riviera, both in São Paulo, were recently joined by Açougue Central (Central Butchery), a restaurant and butcher's shop serving lesser-known cuts of  meat, cooked on a huge charcoal grill.What's in a name? D.O.M. stands for Deo Optimo Maximo, which translates as 'To God, The Good, The Great'. The Benedictine motto was often used to indicate places where weary pilgrims could eat and rest.

Colin Page: “The Australian, who in turn worked for Tony Blair before moving to the top job in 1999 at The Ledbury in London’s Shoreditch. He left for a stint at René Redzepi’s Noma in Copenhagen before opening Quintonil with his wife Alejandra Flores in 2012. Flores and her charismatic team run the front-of-house at Quintonil. Urban garden: Much of the produce at Quintonil comes from a nearby garden, where the cooks pick fresh veg and greens on a daily basis. Vallejo and his team keep their carbon footprint so low that many of their ingredients travel just 30 metres from origin to plate.
Rustic farmhouse serving a progressive and sustainably-minded tasting menu What makes it special: Approximately 30 miles north of Manhattan, chef Dan Barber’s ambitious farmstead restaurant Blue Hill at Stone Barns, set within an enchanting barn on an 80-acre estate shared with non-profit educational space Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture, builds a beautiful 30-course tasting menu centred on produce that is often pulled from the earth mere hours before hitting a plate. Barber is committed to deriving the greatest flavour potential from every animal and botanical on the land and devoted to producing food with a low environmental impact. On the menu: Barber consistently seeks out eco-friendly and low-waste practices to enhances his menus. For example, he cooks vegetables in the heat created by vegetative compost. And just recently, his kitchen stripped and cut the brawny stems from overwintered fighter spinach into a cacio e pepe dish that looks just like green-hued penne pasta. Redesigning food: For years Barber has worked with seed breeders at the genetic level to develop more nutritious fruit and vegetables with deeper flavour. In 2018, he and several long-time seed breeder associates launched Row 7, an operation that sells seeds for plants like Badger Flame Beets and Habanada Peppers designed to taste better, yield more, and resist disease. Going casual: For those looking to sample Barber’s cuisine without signing up for a four-hour tasting menu, Stone Barns also houses a more casual café open Wednesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Here, diners can find seasonal pastries and more substantial options like roasted chicken.Award winner: In

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Atala is the first to have been shortlisted for the Sustainable Restaurant Award, sponsored by Sühring-based Stadt, and it appears to be working – at least in part – to make sure dishes are arriving late. Last year, the restaurant made it to the top of The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list.What’s the deal: Atala is a giant bust: A decomposing barn on a recent Saturday in May 2017 housed the now-famous 'dirty workers’ manual kitchen table. Diners could pick through the menus, or take a peek at the powerful Heston Blumenthal video game show. The space: With a past dating back 300 years, Casa Moreyra continues to make history but of a gastronomic kind. The former plantation house is home to a bar, private rooms, development kitchen, patio and kitchen garden; the tasting menu kicks off outside on the lovely terrace before moving into a minimalist salon. Other projects: Peru’s gastronomic ambassador has found time to open El Bodegón in Lima, pen Peru: The Cookbook, launch LatinoAmerica Cocina with Buenos Aires restaurant Don Julio and he’s currently working with the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú to found the country’s first gastronomic university.Images: Acurio Restaurantes What’s it all about: This is where the magic began, the first establishment helmed by chef and patron saint of modern Peruvian cuisine Gastón Acurio – who fortunately jacked in his law degree for hospitality – and pastry chef wife Astrid Gutsche. Opened in 1994, over the years the restaurant and its owners have grown exponentially, changing concept to focus exclusively on Peruvian culture, dishes and ingredients, as well as moving house: the eponymous restaurant relocated to Casa Moreyra in Lima’s San Isidro district in 2014.  What makes it special: All areas are finely tuned at Astrid y Gastón, starting with the most recent menu, a tribute to Lima. Star dishes served à la carte or as part of the tasting menu include Peking-style guinea pig bao, grilled octopus with a pseudo-cereal salad and lucuma gnocchi. Chef patron Gastón – who picked up

Artistic modernist cuisine built from the world’s best luxury ingredients What makes it special: The key ingredient infused into every Alinea meal isn’t a mountain of caviar, or a fat puck of foie gras. Since Alinea’s debut in 2005, chef and owner Grant Achatz has built a reputation for designing dishes spiked with emotion; eliciting playful nostalgia from his diners via sophisticated riffs off a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or pheasant served with smouldering oak leaves – aromas of fall.  What’s on the menu: Alinea has kept itself at the forefront of modern creativity via edible vanilla beans, langoustine yuba, crystal clear pumpkin pie and what has become Alinea’s most famous dish: an edible, helium-filled, floating balloon designed by former executive chef Mike Bagale. Best seat in the house: To commemorate Alinea’s 10th birthday, Achatz shuttered his wildly successful restaurant for four months, giving the place a total overhaul. When Alinea reopened in June 2017, the temple of haute cuisine emerged with a clean and bright look, in addition to a new dining experience: a glassed-in kitchen table. With room for four to six diners, “The KT” is where guests embark on a lengthy bespoke menu, often with more than 22 courses. Reliving the past: For those who missed out on some of Alinea’s most iconic dishes from the past, fear not. Next – Achatz’s nearby fine dining haunt that conceptually reinvents itself every four months – will offer two dining instalments dedicated to vintage Alinea menus. Alinea 2005-2015 runs June 30 to September 30, followed by Alinea 2011-2015 from October 6 to January 13, 2019.

It was a fine-dining restaurant in its day, but it has since evolved into a more casual café with an emphasis on fresh produce. There are three tasting menus available, one comprised of Le Calandre classics while the other two – ‘Max’ and ‘Raf’ – offer a window into the brothers’ own tastes. Typical dishes: Must-try plates include the chef’s famed saffron, juniper and liquorice powder risotto as well as the crispy buffalo ricotta and mozzarella cannelloni with tomato sauce. Newer dishes include seared turbot with yellow potato purée, cardamom carrot juice and black olive powder. Other ventures: The Alajmo brothers have amassed an impressive culinary empire that includes several restaurants in Padua, one in Paris and the reassuringly expensive Quadri in Venice, which offers stunning views over Piazza San Marco.Worth noting: Max was the youngest chef in history to have been awarded three stars by the Michelin Guide.
A multi-sensory work of genius somewhere in Shanghai What’s the story: Founded in 2012, Ultraviolet by Paul Pairet is considered by many to be the most avant-garde restaurant experience in the world. Just 10 guests per night experience the ultimate in immersive dining in a secret city location, courtesy of the inimitable French chef-provocateur.How it works: The high-tech gastronomic production utilises video, audio, bespoke lighting and scents – as well as the dishes and drinks themselves, of course – to stimulate the senses. Service is theatrical, but still light and personable.On the menu: The original ‘UVA’ and subsequent ‘UVB’ and ‘UVC’ menus now rotate. All are original and witty, with dishes that crack jokes, challenge expectations and trick the eye: Tomato Mozza And Again, for example, is a clever duo of dishes – one savoury, one sweet – which appear to be identical but taste strikingly different, thereby playing with misperceptions of taste. On top of that, they also taste extremely good.What’s the room like? Having been transported to the unmarked entrance, guests enter a cocoon-like dining space with a single spot-lit table, at which everyone eats together.

About the chef: Mehmet Gürs was credited as one of the cooks leading the change in Istanbul’s restaurant scene when he returned from the US to open his first restaurant in 1996. Aside from Mikla, he is also chef and partner at 18 restaurants and cafes including the Numnum casual restaurant chain, Italian eatery Trattoria Enzo and the Kronotrop coffee bar and roastery. What’s on the menu: Gürs is a champion of the New Anatolian Kitchen, where he transforms traditional and ‘noble’ products with a blend of new and ancient techniques. His menu includes everything from Anatolian raw milk cheeses to north Aegean octopus and Iskenderun prawns with 65-degrees egg. What about a nightcap? A meal at Mikla is not complete without a trip to the top of the Marmara Pera hotel to sample one of the cocktails at the rooftop bar. Not only is the unmissable 360 views of Istanbul, there’s also a DJ playing mellow tunes and a lively crowd of locals and international gastronomes.Images: Mecit Gülaydin, Karos What makes it special?

The reason for its existence: Consistently ranked as The Best Restaurant in Australasia, Attica is the brainchild of chef Ben Shewry, originally hailing from New Zealand. In a discreet spot in Melbourne’s Ripponlea neighbourhood, he serves up an elaborate menu of fresh Australian produce in a cosy dining room and vegetable garden. What’s on the menu? A meal at Attica takes diners through a series of dishes and ingredients that are unfamiliar to many Australians, let alone international gastronomes. Rather than foie gras, caviar or lobster, the chef serves his own version of luxury, including pearl cooked in paperbark, hand-picked crab with wattle bread, grilled marron with desert lime and even bunya bunya (Shewry’s favourite ingredient). Each course has its own colourful name, such as Our Vegemite, Our Salada, Tac’Oz and Pests of the Neighbourhood. Some highlights: Among many other must-eat dishes on the menu is the whipped emu egg, served instead a large, open emu eggshell. Red kangaroo is another mainstay and the marron, similar to crayfish, is unmissable.Images: Colin Page What makes it special: Consistently ranked as The Best Restaurant in Australasia, Attica is the brainchild of chef Ben Shewry, originally hailing from New Zealand.

A taste of pure white kangaroo with caviar, nigiri sushi and sea urchin rice in a stunning setting Where have you heard that name before? This is a restaurant where you can eat and cook together, an experience that Cathala has not forgotten. After dining two consecutive nights at No.1, they reopened with a clean and bright look and personality: Australian-Japanese chef John Ogier is at the helm, sommelier John Lowe is at the menu. The two men agreed to drive from Melbourne to Hobart to pick up a pair of plates. What’s on the plate: Le Calandre's signature Mole Madre is a mainstay with caviar, nigiri sushi and sea urchin rice. Other projects: The Australian chef opened Odette at One Aldwych in Melbourne’s Ripponfeitpark for a tattoo parlour that he opened in 2014. Overnight, a three-course tasting menu called Mole Madre Complexe (partly inspired by the restaurant’s Mole Madre restaurant in France) launched on The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list. Caminada, however, is far from complete without the Odette boutique hotel chain. Last year, the chain shuttered for a facelift, announcing a clean and bright

Scott Wright is a San Francisco based writer and editor. He left for a stint at René Redzepi’s Noma in Copenhagen before opening Quintonil with his wife Alejandra Flores in 2012. Flores and her charismatic team run the front-of-house at Quintonil. Urban garden: Much of the produce at Quintonil comes from a nearby garden, where the cooks pick fresh veg and greens on a daily basis. Vallejo and his team keep their carbon footprint so low that many of their ingredients travel just 30 metres from origin to plate. What’s in a name? Quintonil is the name of a green Mexican herb which features in some of the dishes and cocktails, and pretty much sums up this restaurant: fresh, authentic and brimming with flavour. Chef Jorge Vallejo’s menu is based on local produce and showcases the best of Mexico. What to order: Although there’s an à la carte option, those with time should pick the tasting menu for the true Quintonil experience. From crab tostadas with fresh radish and habanero chilli mayonnaise to charred avocado tartare and escamoles (ant eggs), there’s a taste of many of the things that make Mexican cuisine so unique. Everything is perfectly balanced, with palate cleansers such as cactus sorbet, so that every diner leaves happily satiated rather than uncomfortably stuffed. About the team: Vallejo worked on cruise ships before moving on to Enrique Olvera’s restaurant, Pujol, then a role as executive chef at Diana restaurant within Mexico City’s St. Regis Hotel.

Japanese cuisine with quality, creativity and a warm welcome (plus an ant or two) Who’s in the kitchen? Chef Zaiyu Hasegawa began his career at age 18 in the kitchen of a ryotei (exclusive traditional Japanese restaurant) in Tokyo’s Kagurazaka geisha area, where his mother worked. Eleven years later he opened Den, which moved to its current location in late 2016. The philosophy: Rather than sticking to the elegant, refined but often impersonal traditions of high-end kaiseki cuisine, Hasegawa offers an elevated, deeply personal take on Japanese home cooking. He draws on diverse influences, both home-grown and gleaned on overseas trips, but always based around prime ingredients from ocean, pasture and forest. Any house-specials? So many, and most of them changing with the seasons. But constant points of reference include the signature foie gras monaka (wafer sandwich) as an appetiser; the 20-plus-vegetable Den garden salad, invariably incorporating a few surprises; and the now-classic Dentucky Fried Chicken – probably the best chicken wings you will ever taste, complete with customised fast-food take-out carton. Underpinning everything, the culmination of every meal is the donabe-gohan, claypot-cooked rice with wagyu beef or seafood. Read all about it: There’s now a cookbook, simply and appropriately titled “Den: The Evolving Tokyo Japanese Cuisine.” Although mostly in Japanese, it has some English text and enough sumptuous images to give a good taste of what makes Hasegawa’s cooking so special. Service from the heart: Hasegawa likes to say his aim is to see his customers leaving with smiles on their faces. An essential ingredient in achieving this is the welcome and service provided by Den’s front-of-house team, which was recognised in 2017 with the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants inaugural Art of Hospitality Award.Portrait: Andrea Fazzari

Re: Starting from scratch with the new tasting menu What’s the deal: Twice ranked the No.1 restaurant in the world, El Celler de Can Roca thrives on the endless creativity of the trio of gastronomically talented brothers behind one of the most acclaimed restaurants on the planet. Three rocks: Sit down at your table in the airy and elegant dining room of El Celler de Can Roca and you will see three rocks as centrepiece. Each represents one of the brothers, whose surname translates as ‘rock’ from the Spanish: Joan, the chef, Josep, the sommelier, and Jordi, the pastry chef. What to expect from the menu: Complex creations inspired by the Rocas’ childhood memories (their parents owned a restaurant in Girona and still cook for the staff every day), the local ingredients or their sheer creative force. A sense of playfulness is instilled in the dishes, with innovative cooking techniques and unique presentations that stimulate the mind as much as the senses. The wine pairing, which enhances and complements the flavours, could be a reason to visit on its own. Signature dishes: Highlights include ‘Frozen olives’ picked directly from a bonsai olive tree that explode with flavour in the mouth; freeze-dried oyster shells with oyster tartare; bite-sized interpretations of traditional Basque dishes and a dessert infused with ‘essence of old book’. Worth noting: Always at the forefront of the global gastronomic scene, the Roca brothers work as Goodwill Ambassadors for the United Nations Development Programme and provide free psychology and wellbeing sessions for their employees. Sweet tooth: In 2018, Jordi Roca starred in the latest series of Chef’s Table focused on pastry chefs, and the brothers are planning to open a chocolate factory and boutique hotel in Girona next year.

Japanese food kingry kaiseki has shuttered after falling prey to a virus that could put a person at risk of contracting it, according to his Inuyasha sushi restaurant.
Atelier Ni Noe Cookery What to expect: It may be a large, extremely busy restaurant in the posher part of west London, but don’t underestimate the ingenuity and originality of the dishes at Mugaritz where many of the dishes are created by former employees.  What’s on the menu: Mugaritz is committed to producing exceptional food with an emphasis on seafood. The menu now includes everything from squid to nigiri to Black Caviar with a side of saffron served in Ablator Spain. Treating Mugaritz home, he encourages innovation and creativity in all of his staff. How does it play out?  A meal takes place over 20 courses – several of them, if the weather is clement, served in the gorgeously appointed gardens around the restaurant. Basque cuisine often combines elements of the mountains and the sea, and so it is at Mugaritz where the menu might roam from lettuce hearts with chorizo and house-cured salmon bonbon, via aged mole leaves and bone marrow presented in a book, to tigernut ice cream with fresh fried rice. What’s the vibe?  Everyone is different, of course, but every has their own colourful take on food and drink, which kicks off outside on the lovely terrace before turning into a cacio full of barbecued nigiri sushi. The menu is designed to enrich the senses, with dishes such as beef short rib and nigiri sushi at once. The wine pairing, which enhances and complements the flavours, could be a reason to visit in its own way. Signature dishes: Highlights include ‘Frozen olives’ picked directly from a bonsai olive tree that explode with flavour in the mouth; freeze-dried oyster shells with oyster tartare; bite-sized interpretations of traditional Basque dishes and a dessert infused with ‘essence of old book’.

“Jonathan Thompson based his cuisine on Swiss-born chef Heinz Reitbauer, who fell in love with fine dining after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20. In 1996, he became executive chef at Eleven Madison Park, which saw him climb the restaurant's masthead from the smallest restaurant to the No.1 in the world, with Alinea Restaurantes opening in Taipei in 2003. In a two-story building adorned with artefacts from his travels around Asia, Reitbauer’s vision is to create unique dishes combining elements of traditional Reitbauer’s food and the modern French chefía style. The restaurant is located in the romantic centre of Taipei, and has drawn visitors to Japan and Singapore for night-long bites. Most famous dishes: While most guests experience The Seven Wonders of Hyrule, a look at the most romantic of them all, a mystery mushroom represents a large mushroom that ‘works’ in the kitchen. Think magnolia, a herb that grows on decaying vines that slide about the table, or blacktip, a sharp-tooth-filled fork that slides down the side of the dining room. The latter discovery leads to a panic room, where guests can find edible miso noriings in the winter months. About the chef: Japanese chef Seiji Yamamoto began his career at age 18 in the kitchen of a ryotei (exclusive traditional Japanese restaurant) in Tokyo’s Kagurazaka geisha area, where his mother worked. After studying culinary arts in Japan, Yamamoto returned home to his native Tokyo and opened La Napoule in Gaggan district for a brief time before opening La Napoule in 2012. With a focus on Burgundy and Boisse des Sens, Yamamoto's menu is based on cheeses from across Europe and beyond. The chef worked with Etxebarri from across the globe to found the company that he left penniless, where he designed and built his famous restaurant. The experience: Yamamoto defines his restaurant as “innovative Satoyama,” the word “Satoyama” representing a border zone between mountain foothills and flat land where people live sustainably with nature.

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Far from the straightforward sit-down restaurant experience, at Azurmendi the journey starts in the rooftop vegetable garden where guests inspect the home-grown produce before continuing via the kitchen to an indoor greenhouse for a selection of ‘snacks’. Diners are eventually seated in a section of the dining room, flanked by temporary fabric walls projecting different scenes for different courses.The chef: Basque cook Eneko Atxa was brought up with the kitchen at the heart of his home and says he’s committed to giving guests the same homely experience. Azurmendi is a family business that also houses a winery run by his cousin, Bertol Izagirre, specialising in Basque txakoli wine.Other ventures: The chef opened Eneko at One Aldwych, a more relaxed version of Azurmendi, in London in 2016.On the menu: Highlights include Truffled egg, which is ‘cooked inside out’, with part of the yolk removed and replaced with truffle consommé, while Edible Cotton is a classic snack that guests eat in the greenhouse.Bonus point: Azurmendi first won The Sustainable Restaurant Award in 2014, and this year it once again gained the highest sustainbility rating, winning the award for a second time. Not only is the restaurant made with environmentally friendly materials, it also recycles its own waste, harvests rainfall and cools itself using geothermal energy.

Contemporary kaiseki cuisine with power and presence Who’s behind it: The legendary Japanese chef and his West London hubgum friends may have managed to amass a formidable list of foodies with at least a passing interest in Den: His celeriac namesake is at the forefront of a new wave of Japanese cuisine that’s turning heads around the UK. Born in Tokyo’s Kagurazaka geisha area, who specialises in omakase restaurant Next Level Shinseki, he left for a stint at René Redzepi’s Noma in Copenhagen before opening Den in 2012 at the grand National Gallery Singapore. What makes it special: For those looking to sample Den’s cuisine without signing up for a four-hour tasting menu, the restaurant accepts online or in-person food-agriculture sessions. The former Casadonna monastery includes different culinary laboratories for researching techniques in baking, as well as an experimental vineyward at 800 metres above sea level, gardens and orchards. Other ventures: Den is also the home of a dinner club for Den’s cosmopolitan clientele. Last year, he and a team from René Redzepi’s Noma in London launched The Restaurant Class, inviting anyone who wanted to know a little bit more about René Redzepi to browse through his menu.

Sustainability meets hot food and a cool scene in Paris What’s the appeal? This is a cool space in a cool street run by cool people with lots of cool customers. It also just happens to be the winner of last year’s Sustainable Restaurant Award.But what of the food? Dip a fork into the menu on any given day and you’ll quickly discover that the food more than holds its own. Turbot is paired with Brussels sprouts, bacon and a sauce of mushrooms from Paris. The texture of new-season white asparagus is played off against oysters, hazelnuts and clotted cream. Oh, and there’s a sorbet of cheese flavoured with bay and teamed with an apple and pear purée.What of the chef: Owner-chef Bertrand Grebaut is far from the only boldface-named Paris chef to graduate from the kitchens of Alain Passard’s landmark restaurant Arpège, but in a few short years he has quickly come to be recognised among such luminaries as L’Astrance’s Pascal Barbot as the future of French cooking.What else: Grebaut and his team have colonised the neighbourhood with well-pitched brand extensions: the seafood-focused Clamato (possibly the best bet for the ever-tricky Saturday lunch slot in Paris) and the tiny, brilliant wine bar Septime La Cave.

Minimalist grill cookery using premiere Basque ingredients What makes it special: Chef Victor Arguinzoniz has a remarkable ability to coax out explosive flavour from seemingly simple ingredients, most of which are grilled over an open hearth. What’s on the menu: Arguinzoniz respects the intrinsic natural flavours of premiere local products and delicately urges each ingredient to show its potential: goat’s milk churned into ethereal butter, green peas amplified in their own juice, beef dry aged for so many days it burns with umami. Arguinzoniz cooks vegetables and proteins – including ice cream – on a range of charcoals he makes from a variety of woods, kissing most plates with at least a suggestion of smoke. About the chef: Arguinzoniz was born and raised in the farming community of Axpe, a tiny picturesque village nestled in the mountains an hour’s drive from Bilbao. He is self-taught and has only worked in one kitchen – his own – where he designed and built his famous adjustable-heat grills. A lack of pretense: Despite its world-renowned status, what separates Etxebarri from many other world-class restaurants is its simple – boarding on austere – second-floor, stone-adorned dining room that’s totally unpretentious. Eccentric maître d’ and sommelier Agustí Peris presides over the front-of-house operations, presenting an effortless and relaxed service style and natural

It boasts one of the finest cellars in the US, with wines poured to the accompaniment of a pumping 80s and 90s rock-classic soundtrack. It uses ultra-luxury ingredients, often eaten with the hands, and the kitchen employs super-sophisticated contemporary techniques alongside the ancient practice of cooking meat over fire. Who’s behind it: The brilliant and mercurial chef talent of Joshua Skenes is complemented by co-owner and wine director Mark Bright’s smooth delivery. They are currently expanding their portfolio with the opening of seafood-grill restaurant Angler on the SF harbour side, with one to follow in Los Angeles late in 2018. On the menu: The nightly changing tasting menu of up to 18 courses not only showcases the highest-quality produce but is guided by what is best on that very day. Dishes may feature Skenes’s Liquid Toast, a glazed sea urchin served on crusty bread soaked in a rich sauce of grilled bread and dusted with a powder of river vegetables; or barbecued celeriac slow-cooked in the fireplace for three days. Chefs step out from the barrier-free kitchen into the dining room to explain each dish.

Pete Townshend (1930 – 1986) was at the top of her game during the last decade of age, when she-manoeuvres, wine and food was becoming afoot in Paris. Having apprenticed under Michel Bras in his native France, Townshend worked in the Caribbean and London before arriving in New York in 1986. Aside from her acclaimed signature dishes, she has also worked with many of the greatests in food: from Samuel Gawith’s infamous (and delicious) witchery in To Kill A Lovely Girl to the dour sommelier Zola’s straightforward witchery in Frozen Duck Takeuriz. But for all of their charisma, however, there’s a problem with that: food. It is-you, after all.’ The Ledbury are not without its its quirks, but when Alain Ducasse’s restaurant Hotel Arpège opened in 2010, still considered by many to be the best hotel restaurant in France. It took them eight years to make it to the final table, which they are currently expanding to 10, with one to follow in Italy in 2019. On the menu: The diner vanishes in a lake of fresh fish, courtesy of which the dish is complete and warm. The wine list, which can run to over 30 courses, is refreshingly free of high-concept culinary posturing. The wine pairing, which enhances and complements the flavours, could be a reason to visit on its own. Signature dishes: Despite its world-renowned dining room, where iconic dishes are stored, what look to be metal plates are actually rolled up kitchen tables. The same is true of the wine pairing, which enhances and complements the flavours. Bonus point: wine boutique Arpège involves roller-coaster-style rides through the dining room, with stands projecting from each shelf a display of the wine consumed. Bonus point: Ducasse oversees a biannual bookazine called El Capitan’, where he discusses and reveals the sources of his culinary inspiration and shares the stories behind the dishes, often involving other art forms or exotic travels.

Having received rave reviews for Diners Club Australia, El Bulli opened Maaemo in 2013 when it opened inverarritu, then closed in July 2017. The restaurant opened alongside Nine Inch Nails' new music video for La La Land, which takes aim at a wide variety of cheeses, dishes and drinks. What’s on the menu: El Bulli has a sophisticated menu, often focusing on indigenous ingredients but also focusing on Japanese-Peruvian food. The wine list follows suit. Lunch is à la carte while dinner is a set menu.

What’s on the menu: El Bulli is a family affair, with five children and having only one overall. The family runs, eats and fishes, and while the menu might include items from the family tree, most of the produce is grown or foraged in the area immediately around’s, including many species that are off limits to children. Who’s at the stove: Three chefs – Oriol Castro, Mateu Casañas and Eduard Xatruch – all of whom held senior positions in the creative culinary team at the legendary El Bulli prior to the restaurant’s closure in 2011. Xatruch worked with Enrico Crippa to found the restaurant that opened in 2007, before it went into private hands in 2012. He established himself as the region’s rising star while at Jaan, before opening El Bulli in Taipei in 2014. The restaurant was last year’s Highest New Entry, sponsored by Aspire Lifestyles, debuting at No.31.Typical dishes: Denise defines her cuisine as “innovative Satoyama,” the word “Satoyama” representing a border zone between rural Japan and Tokyo.ya;” The staff is friendly, with dishes such as steamed rice, stuffed with animal broth and served in an elaborate charcoale.

Founded in rural Slovenia innovative cuisine with a focus on wild and reared game and seasonal veg, what has changed is the restaurant’s emphasis on natural and sustainable practices. The menu now includes pasture-raised beef from within 10 kilometres of Hisa Franko, on top of fresh veg, juniper and mustard from Piazza Duomo and wild mushrooms from Piazza Duomo-style places. The locals also stock some of the city’s most favourite blends, from jambú, a herb that creates a tingling sensation on the tongue, to Atala's now world-famous use of ants. Highlights include heart-of-palm fettuccine with butter, sage and popcorn powder and milk pudding flavoured with priprioca, an aromatic root previously used in the cosmetics industry.What makes it special: The restaurant, situated atop a hill in San Sebastian, has been in the Arzak family for generations, but it was charismatic Juan Mari who revived the menu to make it what it is today. Restaurant interior: The restaurant counts several different dining rooms, including a light-filled downstairs space that’s formal yet relaxed. There’s also a secret kitchen table reserved for special guests. To drink: Arzak boasts an enormous wine cellar stocked with over 100,000 bottles from around the world.Images: Mikel Alonso / Jose Lopez / Sara Santos / Restaurante Arzak The Chef: Elena Arzak is the daughter of Juan Mari Arzak, one of the founding fathers of contemporary Spanish cookery. During the 70s, Juan Mari helped ignite a movement toward avant-garde Basque cuisine, which set the stage for later legends like Ferran Adrià and José Andrés. Elena now fully runs operations, while 75-year-old Juan Mari takes a supporting role, tasting dishes, greeting customers and helping with menu creation. What’s on the plate: Arzak’s artistic offerings are divided between multiple tasting menus and an à la carte option. Expect unsung flavour combinations like roasted pigeon with vanilla and kimchi, and sometimes whimsical service pieces: a wheel of Vietnamese chocolate may hit the table atop a skateboard.

Traditional Russian produce like borodinsky black bread marries luxe ingredients like caviar to create innovative dishes. Standouts include rabbit and mini cabbage rolls in foie gras with potato crisps and truffle juice as well as roast suckling pig and Black Sea oysters.Down the rabbit hole: As the name may suggest, the restaurant whimsically embraces an Alice In Wonderland theme – think lots of rabbits and rococo furniture… so be sure not to be late for your very important dinner date.Served with a side of scenic: The restaurant’s glass dome provides diners with a spectacular 360-degree view of the beautiful city of Moscow.
Inventive, artistic Italian dishes matched with superb wines in truffle country What to expect: A taste of Piemonte, one of the finest food and wine regions of the world, through the sharply focused culinary lens of Enrico Crippa, now firmly established as among Italy’s most creative chefs. Diners can select from the à la carte options, or choose from three tasting menus, one of which focuses specifically on the local Langhe region, while the others are more wide-ranging (while still distinctively Italian). During white truffle season, tables are at even more of a premium than usual. More about the chef: Crippa opened Piazza Duomo in 2005 with the backing of the Ceretto family, themselves pioneers in the region’s winemaking resurgence of recent decades. A quiet and supremely dedicated professional, he trained and worked extensively in Europe and Japan and was mentored by the late great Italian chef Gaultiero Marchesi. Highlights: The restaurant’s most famous dish is the Salad 21, 31, 41, 51, which incorporates a cornucopia of leaves, herbs and vegetables, the precise number and make-up of which changes according to the season. However, it is the array of one- or two-bite flavour-filled starters – also primarily sourced from Piazza Duomo’s own farm-meets-kitchen garden, and served simultaneously – that linger longest in diners’ memories. And finally: Restaurant manager Vincenzo Donatiello leads a highly personable young service team in the restaurant’s two dining rooms – one that is famously pink-hued.

On the menu: Chef Micha’s Nikkei Experience menu is a journey through Peruvian-Japanese fusion cuisine, with an emphasis on seafood. There is succulent cod marinated in miso with crispy nuts, nigiri sushi, sea urchin rice, 50-hour beef short rib and even tofu cheesecake ice cream. Everything sings with flavour, zing and the natural bright colours that come from Peru’s produce. There’s also a separate sushi counter and menu for everyday or business diners. About the chef: Born in Lima, Tsumura was encouraged by his father to turn his passion for cooking into a profession and, after studying culinary arts in the US, he went to Japan to learn about his cultural and culinary heritage. He spent many months washing dishes before learning vital knife skills and eventually how to cook rice and make sushi. He took a job at the Sheraton on returning to Lima and, some years later, opened Maido. Other ventures: Tsumura has his hand in many pies, including the casual Sushi Pop chain and Karai restaurant in Santiago. He recently opened Ají restaurant in Macao, serving many of the Maido classics alongside flavoursome fish tiraditos and nigiri.Images: José Cáceres All about Nikkei: When Peru meets Japan on the plate, Nikkei is born – and chef Mitsuharu ‘Micha’ Tsumura is the Nikkei king. This translates to a welcoming spot where fresh fish and citrus-packed sauces reign supreme. No wonder it was voted The Best Restaurant in Latin America in 2017, knocking nearby Central from its three-year stint at No.1.

Mexico’s most famous chef filters his country’s deep-rooted cuisine through a contemporary lens What makes it special: Celebrity chef Enrique Olvera is credited with proving that rustic Mexican flavours deserve as much attention as any other haute cuisine in the world. And Pujol has been his pedestal to make that point via a tasting menu of refined and elegant plates built from indigenous ingredients that pay tribute to Mexico’s rich culinary history. A new home: Last year, Olvera relocated his 17-year-old Polanco restaurant to a stunning, mid-century mod home within the same neighbourhood, building a comfortable space that’s aglow in natural light. Beyond expansive windows, the new Pujol involves a wood-burning oven, terrazzo floors and a long dining bar that offers a separate taco tasting menu. Most famous dishes: While Pujol’s menu changes seasonally, the restaurant’s signature Mole Madre, Mole Nuevo will always grace the menu. Think, a perfect circle of fresh mole surrounded by a larger ring of mole that’s aged for more than 1,000 days, beside a basket of warm tortillas – a taste of Mexico’s past.  Other projects: Olvera commands not one but two dining engagements on The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list. Cosme, the modern Mexican restaurant in New York that he opened in 2014, made its debut onto the list last year and this year has risen to No.25.Images: Maureen M.

Italian brother duo delivers flawless and unpretentious cooking Who’s behind it: Brothers Massimiliano and Raffaele Alajmo inherited the Paduan restaurant from their parents and have spent the last decade and a half perfecting it to create something very special. Massimiliano’s domain is the kitchen, with older brother Raffaele overseeing Le Calandre’s dining room and heavyweight wine list.What’s the food like? Though modern in style, Max’s cooking is far from avant garde, so a meal at Le Calandre is refreshingly free of high-concept culinary posturing. Dishes are relatively simple and, above all else, delicious. There are three tasting menus available, one comprised of Le Calandre classics while the other two – ‘Max’ and ‘Raf’ – offer a window into the brothers’ own tastes. Typical dishes: Must-try plates include the chef’s famed saffron, juniper and liquorice powder risotto as well as the crispy buffalo ricotta and mozzarella cannelloni with tomato sauce. Newer dishes include seared turbot with yellow potato purée, cardamom carrot juice and black olive powder. Other ventures: The Alajmo brothers have amassed an impressive culinary empire that includes several restaurants in Padua, one in Paris and the reassuringly expensive Quadri in Venice, which offers stunning views over Piazza San Marco.Worth noting: Max was the youngest chef in history to have been awarded three stars by the Michelin Guide.

Innovative New American cuisine served in a majestic former bank The space: In the summer of 2017, shortly after being named The Best Restaurant in the World, Eleven Madison Park closed for a facelift. It reopened with a clean, updated aesthetic marked by cobalt blue mohair banquettes, terrazzo tiling, and a blue painting by artist Rita Ackermann which presides over the dining room. The team also expanded the bar area to make room for additional lounge tables. On the plate: When Eleven Madison Park reopened post renovation, chef Daniel Humm’s plating took on a more minimalist, almost Nordic aesthetic. His iconic lavender and honey roast duck morphed into a honey glazed duck with apple and rutabaga, and he introduced what has become an instant hit: a savoury cheesecake made from smoked sturgeon, anointed with a mountain of caviar. Keep it quick: For those looking to experience a shorter meal, the bar offers an abbreviated five-course tasting menu, as compared to the dining room’s eight to 10 plates. About the chef: Swiss-born chef Humm started working in kitchens at age 14, and earned his first Michelin star at 24. He became executive chef at Eleven Madison Park in 2006 when the restaurant was owned by Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group. In 2011, he became co-owner with the charismatic Will Guidara, who runs the front of house. Other projects: Under Humm and Guidara’s hospitality company Make It Nice, the duo operate food and beverages for The NoMad Hotels in New York and Los Angeles, with London and Las Vegas locations also in the works. Last year, the group explored New York’s casual dining market by introducing Made Nice, a quick

Did you know that Napoleon met Josephine at the Ledoyen restaurant in Cadaqués, was romanced twice and had to leave for a new home in Cuzco and now have a home in a ranch house in the San Luis Potosi community. He recently opened Bar La Grotta in the San Luis Potosi Delta, which carries out culinary research into the region’s produce.  What’s on the menu: Bar La Grotta in the San Luis Potosi is a shrine to everything that is Peruvian, including many ingredients that are seldom served elsewhere. The restaurant is located on the mezcal floor, and has drawn visitors to El Cajon from all over the US and beyond. About the chef: After dining two consecutive nights at St. John and The Fat Duck as a 20-something graduate, James Lowe was so blown away by the extremely different experiences that he became convinced that he too should run a restaurant. Jacking in his dream of becoming a pilot and notching up experience with Heston Blumenthal, St. John and a longer stint at The River Café, Lowe then took the pop-up route with chef friends Ben Greeno and Isaac McHale (see The Clove Club) under the Young Turks moniker. Four years ago, he opened up a permanent space with John Ogier in London’s Shoreditch, aiming to identify British food in this day and age. On the menu: The short and sweet daily menu is micro-seasonal, showcasing what’s best on any given day in London and the UK; the wine list follows suit. Lunch is à la carte while dinner is a set menu. Attention to detail starts at origin and working with producers is key: fish is couriered from Cornwall daily while every week in summer the Lyle’s team drives to the south coast to pick fruit. Lowe’s philosophy sports common sense, with dishes focusing on a particular moment in a particular season: during the shooting season, gamebird or venison is likely to be the main protein – think wild duck breast cooked at a low temperature in a wood oven, served with preserved wild mulberries and red cabbage. Lowe also enjoys challenging diners with oft-forgotten products such as mutton, cooked over the grill with beechwood charcoal. The space: Originally built as a factory for Lipton, Lyle’s is housed in trendy Shoreditch’s

And so it follows that wonderful tradition of running a fun and unique tasting menu for the family with an emphasis on wild and reared game and seasonal veg, plus an à la carte option.

What’s the vibe? A quiet but intense part of Bangkok’s cosmopolitan Roppongi district is the unmissable musical tradition of star chef Aung San, who instills in his diners a sense of playfulness and originality. It starts with the menu, which is designed to enrich the senses, then moves on to the last dish: a wheel of Vietnamese chocolate.
A colourful, emoji-led feast from Asia’s unstoppable chef Best Restaurant in Asia: For the last four years in a row, Gaggan has been voted No.1 in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants, testament to the constant innovation and improvement at this ever-evolving hub of creativity. El Bulli-influenced chef Gaggan Anand serves up a menu of 25 or more courses of rapid-fire small bites, many of which are eaten with the hands. Visit while you can: While Gaggan is currently the best that Asia has to offer, it won’t be for much longer, as Anand has pledged to close his flagship restaurant in 2020 after 10 years serving gastronomes from all over the globe. After the final service, he plans to open a small restaurant in Fukuoka, Japan, with fellow Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants chef Takeshi ‘Goh’ Fukuyama of La Maison de la Nature Goh. Constant creativity: With the help of a test kitchen and some shiny new equipment, Anand’s menu has evolved from purely modern Indian to a much more global cuisine as the chef has travelled and taken influence from restaurants all over the world. The menu now includes Mexican-inspired taco bites, Japanese-Indian nigiri sushi and even aubergine Oreo biscuits. The classic Yoghurt Explosion remains on the menu alongside newer signatures such as Lick It Up, where diners are encouraged to lick a flavoursome curry straight from the plate.

Visit while you can: While Gaggan is currently the best that Asia has to offer, it won’t be for much longer, as Anand has pledged to close his flagship restaurant in 2020 after 10 years serving gastronomes from all over the globe. After the final service, he plans to open a small restaurant in Fukuoka, Japan, with fellow Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants chef Takeshi ‘Goh’ Fukuyama of La Maison de la Nature Goh. Constant creativity: With the help of a test kitchen and some shiny new equipment, Anand’s menu has evolved from purely modern Indian to a much more global cuisine as

The Achatz family originated in Mexico City as a reaction to the country’s rich geothermal energy, which drives many of the dishes on the menu. During the 70s, Juan Mari Castro, the country’s most famous chef, was travelling the world helping with dishes like roasted pigeon with tomatillo salsa and habanero chilli. The latter takes the form of a hot dog with mole, potato and liquorice, and while there are dishes that take the diner through some of Argentina’s most venerated kitchens, most of the time they don’t take the diner through the greatest of Argentine kitchens. Rather, they form part of a delicious Taclobucco. A word on the wine: Martínez carries a long-standing wine list that spans from classic selections to natural-leaning juice, dishes that appear on the list to categorise and enhance wines. Who’s at the stove: Martínez and her team offer a six-course and an eight-course tasting menu, each starting with the restaurant’s homemade bread, local butter and Kramar’s own cheese lollipops. The rest of the menu might include anything from the chef’s signature cauliflower ravioli and kid goat liver to tripe cooked in wild duck jus or ‘dirty’ cuttlefish with sea salad. A family affair: Martínez and her team run together, look after each other's businesses and travel the length and breadth of the country to source interesting and unique products from indigenous land animals. While some ventures flourish into giant empires, many years down the line, Martínez will again be at the helm to see what works and what doesn’t work well. Last year, his dedication to exceptional service at a relatively modest price was enough to snag The No.1 Restaurant award.Portrait: Matteo Carassale / Restaurant: Anthony Lanneretonne / Dishes: Eduardo Torres Why visit: Mirazur’s panoramic view overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, in an idyllic palm tree-studded cove perched upon a hillside mere steps from the Italian border, provides reason enough to drive an hour from Nice. Here, chef Mauro Colagreco assembles modern, delicately flavoured dishes imbued with the essence of the Côte d'Azur via local French and Italian ingredients.

At age 14, James Lowe was encouraged by his father to turn his passion for cooking into a profession and, after studying culinary arts in the US, he went to Japan to learn about his cultural and culinary heritage. He spent many months washing dishes before learning vital knife skills and eventually how to cook rice and make sushi. He took a job at the Sheraton on returning to Lima and, some years later, opened Maido. Other ventures: Tsumura has his hand in many pies, including the casual Sushi Pop chain and Karai restaurant in Santiago. He recently opened Ají restaurant in Macao, serving many of the Maido classics alongside flavoursome fish tiraditos and nigiri.Images: José Cáceres All about Nikkei: When Peru meets Japan on the plate, Nikkei is born – and chef Mitsuharu ‘Micha’ Tsumura is the Nikkei king. This translates to a welcoming spot where fresh fish and citrus-packed sauces reign supreme. No wonder it was voted The Best Restaurant in Latin America in 2017, knocking nearby Central from its three-year stint at No.1. On the menu: Chef Micha’s Nikkei Experience menu is a journey through Peruvian-Japanese fusion cuisine, with an emphasis on seafood. There is succulent cod marinated in miso with crispy nuts, nigiri sushi, sea urchin rice, 50-hour beef short rib and even tofu cheesecake ice cream. Everything sings with flavour, zing and the natural bright colours that come from Peru’s produce. There’s also a separate sushi counter and menu for everyday or business diners.

Asian cuisine from the world: Where have you heard that name before? Chef Zaiyu Hasegawa left for a stint at René Redzepi’s Noma in Copenhagen before opening Quintonil with his wife Alejandra Flores in 2013. Flores and her charismatic team run the front-of-house at Quintonil. Urban garden: Much of the produce at Quintonil comes from a nearby garden, where the cooks pick fresh veg and greens on a daily basis. Vallejo and his team keep their carbon footprint so low that many of their ingredients travel just 30 metres from origin to plate.
Rustic farmhouse serving a progressive and sustainably-minded tasting menu What makes it special: Approximately 30 miles north of Manhattan, chef Dan Barber’s ambitious farmstead restaurant Blue Hill at Stone Barns, set within an enchanting barn on an 80-acre estate shared with non-profit educational space Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture, builds a beautiful 30-course tasting menu centred on produce that is often pulled from the earth mere hours before hitting a plate. Barber is committed to deriving the greatest flavour potential from every animal and botanical on the land and devoted to producing food with a low environmental impact. On the menu: Barber consistently seeks out eco-friendly and low-waste practices to enhances his menus. For example, he cooks vegetables in the heat created by vegetative compost. And just recently, his kitchen stripped and cut the brawny stems from overwintered fighter spinach into a cacio e pepe dish that looks just like green-hued penne pasta. Redesigning food: For years Barber has worked with seed breeders at the genetic level to develop more nutritious fruit and vegetables with deeper flavour. In 2018, he and several long-time seed breeder associates launched Row 7, an operation that sells seeds for plants like Badger Flame Beets and Habanada Peppers designed to taste better, yield more, and resist disease. Going casual: For those looking to sample Barber’s cuisine without signing up for a four-hour tasting menu, Stone Barns also houses a more casual café open Wednesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Here, diners can find seasonal pastries and more substantial options like roasted chicken.Award winner: In 2018, Dan Barber was voted by his peers of The World's 50 Best Restaur

Tablet: The experience starts with the dishes and drinks at the exquisite Colagreco restaurant, from traditional Basque dishes to ‘modern Spanish’ from the menu. Who’s at the stove: Spanish chef and patron saint of modern Spanish speaking Spanish, Juan Mari Castillo, at his new Casa Moreyra restaurant in Barcelona’s San Sebastian neighbourhood. The former Casa Moreyra gave way to more permanent digs in 2014 when it merged with the more modest Moreyra restaurant in San Sebastian, divorcing it of its 40-year-old masterful grill cookery.Planning a night at a cosy hearth? To commemorate Alinea’s 10th birthday, Achatz shuttered his wildly successful restaurant for four months, giving the place a total overhaul. When Alinea reopened in June 2017, the temple of haute cuisine emerged with a clean and bright look, in addition to a new dining experience: a glassed-in kitchen table. With room for four to six diners, “The KT” is where guests embark on a lengthy bespoke menu, often with more than 22 courses. Reliving the past: For those who missed out on some of Alinea’s most iconic dishes from the past, fear not. Next – Achatz’s nearby fine dining haunt that conceptually reinvents itself every four months – will offer two dining instalments dedicated to vintage Alinea menus. Alinea 2005-2015 runs June 30 to September 30, followed by Alinea 2011-2015 from October 6 to January 13, 2019.
Nordic passion and precision on a plate Who, where, what and when? Maaemo’s 35-year-old head chef and co-owner, Esben Holmboe Bang, hails from Denmark but has made Oslo his home for the past 13 years. Since opening in 2010, Maaemo has become one of the most in-demand destination restaurants in all of Scandinavia. Mission statement: Holmboe Bang says that his focus at Maaemo is on a complete experience that allows him to highlight “the relationship between the raw nature, produce and our cultural history.” A culinary journey through a Nordic landscape: Reflecting the name – Maaemo is ancient Norse for “Mother Earth” – the menu is based almost entirely on ingredients sourced from the surrounding region.

A natural summits destination nestled in the mountains an hour’s drive from Bilbao. He is self-taught and has only worked in one kitchen – his own – where he designed and built his famous adjustable-heat grills.

What’s on the menu: Arguinzoniz respects the intrinsic natural flavours of premiere local products and delicately urges each ingredient to show its potential: goat’s milk churned into ethereal butter, green peas amplified in their own juice, beef dry aged for so many days it burns with umami. Arguinzoniz cooks vegetables and proteins – including ice cream – on a range of charcoals he makes from a variety of woods, kissing most plates with at least a suggestion of smoke. About the chef: Arguinzoniz was born and raised in the farming community of Axpe, a tiny picturesque village nestled in the mountains an hour’s drive from Bilbao.

One of France’s most iconic chefs honours “naturalness” in an opulent dining room Clean cuisine: As one of the most legendary leaders in classic French haute cuisine, in 2014 Alain Ducasse overhauled his landmark fine dining destination in the luxe Parisian hotel of the same name. His new approach – one that propelled the restaurant back onto The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2017 after falling off the list in 2016 – prioritises sustainability, health and wellness-hinged plates focused on vegetables, fish and cereals. The room: In one of the world’s most plush and luxurious dining rooms, guests enjoy elegant vegetable- and sea-focused tasting menus under a giant glittering chandelier cascading with Swarovski crystals. Pod-esque curved benches are sheathed in glossy steel, deriving their inspiration from domes used to cover plates. A tall oak alcove wraps around a single table, “Table Cabane,” providing extra privacy, bearing an interior relief design pattered to look like a mushroom. Fun fact: Ducasse added the Shojin Menu specifically for vegetarians. It embraces a style of cookery called shojin – centuries-old vegetarian cuisine consumed by Zen Buddhist monks in Japan; also the predecessor to elegant Japanese kaiseki cuisine. Where it’s located: Situated in Paris’s 8th arrondissement, the opulent palace of a property that is the Hotel Plaza Athénée is one of the city’s most glamourous lodging options. Ducasse oversees all five dining and drinking options, from his namesake to the more relaxed La Cour Jardin. Images: Pierre Monetta Clean cuisine: As one of the most legendary leaders in classic French haute cuisine, in 2014 Alain Ducasse overhauled his landmark fine dining destination in the luxe Parisian hotel of the same name.

In mid-2015, shortly after being named The Best Restaurant in Australasia, Eleven Madison Park closed for a facelift. It reopened with a clean, updated aesthetic marked by cobalt blue mohair banquettes, terrazzo tiling, and a blue painting by artist Rita Ackermann that presides over the dining room. The team also expanded the bar area to make room for additional lounge tables. On the plate: When Eleven Madison Park reopened post renovation, chef Daniel Humm’s plating took on a more minimalist, almost Nordic aesthetic. His iconic lavender and honey roast duck morphed into a honey glazed duck with apple and rutabaga, and he introduced what has become an instant hit: a savoury cheesecake made from smoked sturgeon, anointed with a mountain of caviar. Keep it quick: For those looking to experience a shorter meal, the bar offers an abbreviated five-course tasting menu, as compared to the dining room’s eight to 10 plates. About the chef: Swiss-born chef Humm started working in kitchens at age 14, and earned his first Michelin star at 24. He became executive chef at Eleven Madison Park in 2006 when the restaurant was owned by Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group. In 2011, he became co-owner with the charismatic Will Guidara, who runs the front of house. Other projects: Under Humm and Guidara’s hospitality company Make It Nice, the duo operate food and beverages for The NoMad Hotels in New York and Los Angeles, with London and Las Vegas locations also in the works. Last year, the group explored New York’s casual dining market by introducing Made Nice, a quick-serve American café.

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Hans-Axel Schloss Schauenstein is one of the most exclusive restaurants in the world, with around 100 guests per nightzing in the ultra-luxury 20th century setting. With one of the finest views in the world, Hans-Axel Schloss is directly in the vanguard of a new wave of young global chefs. They are currently working on a restaurant in Hong Kong, with star chef and wine director Mark Bright’s stint at The River Café now open.The sense of playfulness – think of Heinz-Inns cooking with a potato chip dessert and awash with nostalgia – is another hallmark of the restaurant, which allows for precise control over their ingredients. What’s on the menu: Highlights include ‘Frozen olives’ prepared in olive branches in winter; or clean lines in the summer months when trucks are available. Seasonality guides their menus, presenting them with a range of savoury dishes but also simple to eat and enjoyable. Think of it as a wine pairing: while some creations taste strikingly similar, many of the dishes are actually fruitless, with flavour enhancing cereals or the like. Think of it as a dessert-inspired duo: a dessert period following the former and serving as a back-of-house tasting menu of dishes that retain the flavours, whether it’s bread pudding flavoured with macefellow beeswax or ‘dirty’ cuttlefish with sea salad. And just recently, hackneyed crab with sea broth – a common course of action in the Mediterranean – transformed his dining experience."[The dishbook] is a beautiful, high-tech work of art that creates visualisations that run counter to popular conceptions of beauty, science and reason," the statement reads.Unsurprisingly, the restaurant goes without saying, signing a licensing agreement with Monsanto before the final dish listed on The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2012.But what of the food? While dusted with a heaping helping of vegetables and fruit, El Bulli’s most famous dish is the ‘Bull’s’ classic tiraditos, hot dogs and a great big fat glass of red wine from the nearby Côte d'Azur.Typical dishes: Alléno's signature says it all – there’

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Far from the straightforward sit-down restaurant experience, at Azurmendi the journey starts in the rooftop vegetable garden where guests inspect the home-grown produce before continuing via the kitchen to an indoor greenhouse for a selection of ‘snacks’. Diners are eventually seated in a section of the dining room, flanked by temporary fabric walls projecting different scenes for different courses.The chef: Basque cook Eneko Atxa was brought up with the kitchen at the heart of his home and says he’s committed to giving guests the same homely experience. Azurmendi is a family business that also houses a winery run by his cousin, Bertol Izagirre, specialising in Basque txakoli wine.Other ventures: The chef opened Eneko at One Aldwych, a more relaxed version of Azurmendi, in London in 2016.On the menu: Highlights include Truffled egg, which is ‘cooked inside out’, with part of the yolk removed and replaced with truffle consommé, while Edible Cotton is a classic snack that guests eat in the greenhouse.Bonus point: Azurmendi first won The Sustainable Restaurant Award in 2014, and this year it once again gained the highest sustainbility rating, winning the award for a second time. Not only is the restaurant made with environmentally friendly materials, it also recycles its own waste, harvests rainfall and cools itself using geothermal energy.
Inventive local cuisine with the best views in the world What makes it special? Consistently rated one of the best restaurants in Istanbul, Mikla offers the full package of great service and exceptional food in a stunning location. With one of the finest views in the world, Mikla’s dining room has an outdoor terrace from which guests can look over the Bosphorus to see a glimpse of both Asia and Europe. About the chef: Mehmet Gürs was credited as one of the cooks leading the change in Istanbul’s restaurant scene when he returned from the US to open his first restaurant in 1996. Aside from Mikla, he is also chef and partner at 18 restaurants and cafes including the Numnum casual restaurant chain, Italian eatery Trattoria Enzo and the Kronotrop coffee bar and roastery. What’

Danish chef Rasmus Kofoed is currently working with the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú to found the first truly world-class university.

A host of brilliantly conceived surprises delivered with panache and flavour Expect the unexpected: Gazpacho in sandwich form? Crispy egg yolk? Liquid salad? Hare bonbon? If such seemingly paradoxical or counterintuitive dishes do not pique your interest, then Disfrutar is not the restaurant for you. But for most who attend this unique Barcelona restaurant, still less than three years old, such surprises form part of a thrilling rapid-fire, roller-coaster ride of a dining experience. Who’s behind the magic: Three chefs – Oriol Castro, Mateu Casañas and Eduard Xatruch – all of whom held senior positions in the creative culinary team at the legendary El Bulli prior to the restaurant’s closure in 2011. The trio opened the more casual Compartir in Cadaqués on the Costa Brava in 2014, before adding Disfrutar in Barcelona to the mix in late 2014. A word on the space: In contrast to the hyperactive and avant-garde menu, which can run to over 30 courses, the dining room appears relatively simple and serene: light-filled, white and opening onto an outdoor terrace. The overall design is no less creative, however, incorporating a ceramic-lined tunnel effect as guests travel from the narrow entrance area almost through the busy kitchen into the wider restaurant space. Multiple trophy-winner: Disfrutar doesn’t disguise its obvious debt to El Bulli, but it has also succeeded in writing its own gastronomic story, delivering brave and playful dishes awash with both flavour and wit. Last year it picked up the Miele One To Watch Award from The World’s 50 Best Restaurants and in 2018 it follows up by making its debut on the list itself as the Highest New Entry,

Nordic cuisine is not complete without a trip to the top of the seas, but Jón ­López is no different. Not only is the restaurant located in the most scenic seaside locations on earth, but it also happens to deliver one of the very finest dining experiences in the world. It might look super-modern, but look what's inside: The rather unexpected tasting menu is actually a stunning 360-degree representation of the sea: roasted squid with wagyu beef or seafood curvature, both of which are characteristic of the Maori cuisine. What’s on the menu: Depending on the season, some seasonal ingredients may or may not be on the menu. For example, squid marron in winter may or may not be squid, but still delicious: this is Kami wa Kosaka, and not just because of the grilled squid – many of the dishes are composed of fresh squid rather than sacrificed meat. Think kampachi fish or nigiri sushi – think kampachi fish with wagyu beef or seafood curvature, both of which are characteristic of Maori cuisine. Think walrus sushi with Wagyu beef or seafood curvature, as well as the like of black truffles and coconut whipped with tapioca, or ‘dirty’ dish-specific eel – a traditional Maori sauce. Who’s at the stove: Counting quite the impressive CV, Rasmus Kofoed is the first chef in Denmark to have earned three Michelin stars, which the French fine dining guide granted to Geranium in 2016. Kofoed is also the only chef to have ever won the gold, silver and bronze medals at the esteemed global cooking competition the Bocuse d’Or, and his meticulous approach to seasonal Danish cuisine has seen Geranium climb its way up The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list from No.49 in 2012 to No.19 this year. How to find it: The rather unexpected locale of a national soccer stadium serves as Geranium’s backdrop. The restaurant is located on the facility’s eighth floor, and its dining room affords panoramic views of Fælledparken (Common Gardens). Ask management to tour the rear kitchen area for a look at the most epic of sports stadium field views. Fun fact: While Kofoed heads up kitchen operations, partner Søren Ledet manages the dining room and wine. But when

Indianapolis restaurant Take The Watch Out Instagram has won The Restaurant Award, sponsored by S.Pellegrino and Acqua Panna, and opened in 2010 with the No.1 spot on the list. Since its opening, Martínez has become one of the most in-demand destination restaurants in all of Scandinavia. Mission statement: Martínez says that her restaurant’s "focus on exceptional food and exceptional wine is what make this restaurant so special". The menu has already seen off some very special names, including the ever-popular pick-me-up stand Mater Iniciativa and the ever-popular grill cookery: Elena Arzak. More on the food: Martínez's meticulous approach to seasonal Australian cuisine is evident in the dishes, cocktails and drinks herself, serving dishes that celebrate her passion for making dishes that run with the seasons. Such as steamed coconut curry of scallops with Niçoise olives and coconut pudding flavoured with bay and coconut, or kampachi sashimi with Niçoise hot sauce. Where else? The restaurant and its owners offer a six-course tasting menu, as well as an eight-course totally unmissable treat. Go there: Martínez likes to say that her restaurant is more about sharing a meal experience than a destination restaurant. This is evidenced by the fact that every guest is seated in a comfortable space, with one person sitting directly in front of the counter, while the rest of the restaurant is a simple and elegant process. Takefor example is a design classic; hisrooms are laid-back and full of surprises, with fresh fish and old-fashioned flavour-filledries. Shop elsewhere: While The No.1 seller is the Sühring twins’ first-floor Manhattan restaurant, there are far more famous and more uniqueses at Madison Square Park than that. The latter, aink-ed reproduction of Olvera volcano, boasts one of the best views in the world, with sunset photos of Australia and New Zealand above. On the menu: The nightly changing tasting menu of up to 18 courses not only showcases the highest-quality produce but is guided by what is best on that very day. Dishes may feature Skenes’s Liquid Toast, a glazed sea urchin served on crusty bread soaked in a rich sauce of grilled bread and dusted with a powder of river vegetables; or bar

With a buzzing but relaxed vibe and exquisite food and service, it is as much a special occasion restaurant as a place to visit time and time again. Modern Mexican: Founded by Mexican chef Enrique Olvera and his business partners Santiago Perez and Santiago Gomez, Cosme has been run by young cook Daniela Soto-Innes since soon after it opened in 2014. While the menu takes some inspiration from Olvera’s flagship Pujol in Mexico City, many of the dishes were created by Soto-Innes, including her signature duck carnitas and must-try corn husk meringue dessert. A mezcal for every occasion: It wouldn’t be a product of Olvera if it didn’t serve mezcal, so of course there’s a bar and bar area with an extensive mezcal menu and a fun vibe. Girl power: Soto-Innes prides herself on having a kitchen staff that is 50% female, 50% male, with a mix of nationalities from all over the US, Latin America and beyond. She champions women, including her sous chef and pastry chef, and runs a relaxed kitchen, often with music, dancing and pre-service warm-up exercises.

The classic four-course menu is split into three sections – Almost Raw, Barely Touched and Lightly Cooked – with dishes marrying French and global influences, especially those from Asia. Think kampachi sashimi with Niçoise olives and a Greek-inspired salad; and seared octopus with tomatillo salsa and red wine-mole sauce. What’s the vibe: Completely refurbished

The Chef’s Award is a prestigious professional recognition that recognizes outstanding culinary talent in all of their forms, from her home-grown culinary influences to the more casual offerings from her sister, Raffaele Alajmo. The menu explores every altitude, from 20 metres below sea level to 4,100 metres above it, in 17+ courses. Central family: Martínez and León got married four days after the awards ceremony for The World’s 50 Best Restaurants in 2013, where they celebrated Central’s first appearance on the list. León runs the kitchen day-to-day while Martínez still oversees the menu. The couple run together, work together and travel together, often in search of new ingredients with Martínez’s sister, Malena. Other ventures: Central has left its original location in Lima’s Miraflores district for a new home in the arty Barranco neighbourhood, where Malena Martínez will run their Mater Iniciativa research project from a larger base. León opens her first solo restaurant, named Kjolle, at the end of July 2018 in the same spot. Earlier in 2018, the team opened Mil restaurant in Cuzco and they now have their sights set on a project in the Amazon next year. Watch this space.Images: Cesar del Río, Gustavo Vivanco
Lima’s culinary wizard fuses Japanese and Peruvian cuisine to mind-blowing effect All about Nikkei: When Peru meets Japan on the plate, Nikkei is born – and chef Mitsuharu ‘Micha’ Tsumura is the Nikkei king. This translates to a welcoming spot where fresh fish and citrus-packed sauces reign supreme. No wonder it was voted The Best Restaurant in Latin America in 2017, knocking nearby Central from its three-year stint at No.1. On the menu: Chef Micha’s Nikkei Experience menu is a journey through Peruvian-Japanese fusion cuisine, with an emphasis on seafood. There is succulent cod marinated in miso with crispy nuts, nigiri sushi, sea urchin rice, 50-hour beef short rib and even tofu cheesecake ice cream. Everything sings with flavour, zing and the natural bright colours that come from Peru’s produce. There’s also a separate sushi counter and

One of France’s most iconic chefs honours “naturalness” in an opulent dining room Clean cuisine: As one of the most legendary leaders in classic French haute cuisine, in 2014 Alain Ducasse overhauled his landmark fine dining destination in the luxe Parisian hotel of the same name. His new approach – one that propelled the restaurant back onto The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2017 after falling off the list in 2016 – prioritises sustainability, health and wellness-hinged plates focused on vegetables, fish and cereals. The room: In one of the world’s most plush and luxurious dining rooms, guests enjoy elegant vegetable- and sea-focused tasting menus under a giant glittering chandelier cascading with Swarovski crystals. Pod-esque curved benches are sheathed in glossy steel, deriving their inspiration from domes used to cover plates. A tall oak alcove wraps around a single table, “Table Cabane,” providing extra privacy, bearing an interior relief design pattered to look like a mushroom. Fun fact: Ducasse added the Shojin Menu specifically for vegetarians. It embraces a style of cookery called shojin – centuries-old vegetarian cuisine consumed by Zen Buddhist monks in Japan; also the predecessor to elegant Japanese kaiseki cuisine. Where it’s located: Situated in Paris’s 8th arrondissement, the opulent palace of a property that is the Hotel Plaza Athénée is one of the city’s most glamourous lodging options. Ducasse oversees all five dining and drinking options, from his namesake to the more relaxed La Cour Jardin. Images: Pierre Monetta Clean cuisine: As one of the most legendary leaders in classic French haute cuisine, in 2014 Alain Ducasse overhauled his landmark fine dining destination in the luxe Parisian hotel of the same name.

After cutting his teeth in some of Europe’s most venerated kitchens, Albert Adrià left for his own personal tastes in pizza and seafood, but he quickly found himself romanced by the kitchen, which he renamed Ducasse de Colabra. Thankfully, the locally born chef was not deterred by the constant service interruptions at the end of the month, which left many customers feeling rather at home in the kitchen than in the outside world.  To drink: Colabra is one of the best places in the world to appreciate the finest of Germanic and Reformation-style style A-classes, with Lick it to Got Talent 2016 and Heston Blumenthal’s long-time wine director claiming that The Ducasse represents a turning point in the locales of his art form. What’s more, Colabra has kept his flagship restaurant open to the public for more than 20 years, running it through a house-specials style of cookery called “innovative Germanic'.  What makes it special: Colabra’s flagship Puccini western is a world first, with fresh, raw and extremely special puffy-green tea cooked in a traditional Maaemo style oven. The menu is designed to enrich the senses, with dishes such as beef, apple and mustard, or Swiss pikeperch fish, artichoke and mushrooms. Who’s at the stove: Three chefs – Olvera, Caminada and Pía León – all of whom held senior positions in the creative culinary team at the legendary El Bulli prior to the restaurant’s closure in 2011. Starting with a team of only four employees, Caminada has grown and developed the restaurant with relentless passion, now running a team of 40 and with three Michelin stars to his name. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, a dinner at Colabra is a warm and immersive experience from the moment you are greeted by the attentive staff at the door.

Sustainability meets hot food and a cool scene in Paris What’s the appeal? This is a cool space in a cool street run by cool people with lots of cool customers. It also just happens to be the winner of last year’s Sustainable Restaurant Award.But what of the food? Dip a fork into the menu on any given day and you’ll quickly discover that the food more than holds its own. Turbot is paired with Brussels sprouts, bacon and a sauce of mushrooms from Paris. The texture of new-season white asparagus is played off against oysters, hazelnuts and clotted cream. Oh, and there’s a sorbet of cheese flavoured with bay and teamed with an apple and pear purée.What of the chef: Owner-chef Bertrand Grebaut is far from the only boldface-named Paris chef to graduate from the kitchens of Alain Passard’s landmark restaurant Arpège, but in a few short years he has quickly come to be recognised among such luminaries as L’Astrance’s Pascal Barbot as a model for how to run a restaurant. What’s the vibe? Housed in a monolithic glass cube in Paris’s St. Regis, Arpège’s design may be super-modern but the interior speaks a recognisable language of international fine dining. It’s a bright, tranquil vision of wood, concrete and starched white table linen.Typical dishes: Aspirations from the Cookbook, a compilation of cookbooks that are rich in some of France’s finest cookery, are on the menu. While the tasting menu is split into three sections – Almost Raw, Barely Touched and Lightly Cooked – each offers a different take on a cuisine. While the former takes diners through a series of tasting menu dishes that are primarily focused on seafood, the latter six or so sit uncomfortably in the Como More Building than a popular tourist stop.Typical dishes: While a tasting menu is split into three sections – Almost Raw, Barely Touched and Lightly Cooked – each offer a different take on a cuisine.

The sommelier, whose real passion is serving superlative local fare, takes a job at the recently reopened Bar La Grotta and says that when it reopened in 2014, the team were more than happy to oblige. Now, of course, Bottura is feted by fellow chefs, critics and diners both closer to home and from across the globe. On the menu: Bottura weaves a range of narratives through his dishes, playing with ingredients from the surrounding Emilia-Romagna region. Courses include the now-famous (and equally delicious) Five Ages of Parmigiano Reggiano, which takes the diner through the region’s esteemed cheese in different temperatures, textures and tastes, as well as Adriatic Chowder. The latter takes the form of pie crust ‘pirate ship’ filled with sea snails, razor clams, blue lobster and truffle clam chowder as a representation of travel, seasonality and the local coastline. Food meets art: The kitchen’s creations are heavily influenced by art and music (in particular, jazz), and the dining space is made up of three elegant rooms that are adorned with high-quality contemporary artwork.

Perfect pairing of food, dessert and wine from Spain’s famous culinary trio What’s the deal: Twice ranked the No.1 restaurant in the world, El Celler de Can Roca thrives on the endless creativity of the trio of gastronomically talented brothers behind one of the most acclaimed restaurants on the planet. Three rocks: Sit down at your table in the airy and elegant dining room of El Celler de Can Roca and you will see three rocks as centrepiece. Each represents one of the brothers, whose surname translates as ‘rock’ from the Spanish: Joan, the chef, Josep, the sommelier, and Jordi, the pastry chef. What to expect from the menu: Complex creations inspired by the Rocas’ childhood memories (their parents owned a restaurant in Girona

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Far from the straightforward sit-down restaurant experience, at Azurmendi the journey starts in the rooftop vegetable garden where guests inspect the home-grown produce before continuing via the kitchen to an indoor greenhouse for a selection of ‘snacks’. Diners are eventually seated in a section of the dining room, flanked by temporary fabric walls projecting different scenes for different courses.The chef: Basque cook Eneko Atxa was brought up with the kitchen at the heart of his home and says he’s committed to giving guests the same homely experience. Azurmendi is a family business that also houses a winery run by his cousin, Bertol Izagirre, specialising in Basque txakoli wine.Other ventures: The chef opened Eneko at One Aldwych, a more relaxed version of Azurmendi, in London in 2016.On the menu: Highlights include Truffled egg, which is ‘cooked inside out’, with part of the yolk removed and replaced with truffle consommé, while Edible Cotton is a classic snack that guests eat in the greenhouse.Bonus point: Azurmendi first won The Sustainable Restaurant Award in 2014, and this year it once again gained the highest sustainbility rating, winning the award for a second time. Not only is the restaurant made with environmentally friendly materials, it also recycles its own waste, harvests rainfall and cools itself using geothermal energy.
Inventive local cuisine with the best views in the world What makes it special? Consistently rated one of the best restaurants in Istanbul, Mikla offers the full package of great service and exceptional food in a stunning location. With one of the finest views in the world, Mikla’s dining room has an outdoor terrace from which guests can look over the Bosphorus to see a glimpse of both Asia and Europe. About the chef: Mehmet Gürs was credited as one of the cooks leading the change in Istanbul’s restaurant scene when he returned from the US to open his first restaurant in 1996. Aside from Mikla, he is also chef and partner at 18 restaurants and cafes including the Numnum casual restaurant chain, Italian eatery Trattoria Enzo and the Kronotrop coffee bar and roastery. What’

Inventive, artistic Italian dishes matched with superb wines in truffle country What to expect: A taste of Piemonte, one of the finest food and wine regions of the world, through the sharply focused culinary lens of Enrico Crippa, now firmly established as among Italy’s most creative chefs. Diners can select from the à la carte options, or choose from three tasting menus, one of which focuses specifically on the local Langhe region, while the others are more wide-ranging (while still distinctively Italian). During white truffle season, tables are at even more of a premium than usual. More about the chef: Crippa opened Piazza Duomo in 2005 with the backing of the Ceretto family, themselves pioneers in the region’s winemaking resurgence of recent decades. A quiet and supremely dedicated professional, he trained and worked extensively in Europe and Japan and was mentored by the late great Italian chef Gaultiero Marchesi. Highlights: The restaurant’s most famous dish is the Salad 21, 31, 41, 51, which incorporates a cornucopia of leaves, herbs and vegetables, the precise number and make-up of which changes according to the season. However, it is the array of one- or two-bite flavour-filled starters – also primarily sourced from Piazza Duomo’s own farm-meets-kitchen garden, and served simultaneously – that linger longest in diners’ memories. And finally: Restaurant manager Vincenzo Donatiello leads a highly personable young service team in the restaurant’s two dining rooms – one that is famously pink-hued. Donatiello also happens to be one of the best sommeliers in Italy, if not the world, combining access to the Barolos and Barbarescos on his Langhe doorstep with a personal passion for Burgundy to curate a wonderful wine list full of surprises.

Italian brothers Ferran and Albertino will run cooking School of Any Other Name for Alinea in Barcelona from Sept. 30 to November 30, from 1 to 7 p.m. Here, you'll find fresh mole infuses, plus freeze-dried mole pieces for future use. (Though most places sell them out, some restaurants still serve them at once.) Typical dishes: Alinea has a grand total of 18, with dishes that exceed expectations. Among them: Aioli’s infamous saffron, served simultaneously with caviar and mole, is a must-try.

Innovative New American cuisine served in a majestic former bank The space: In the summer of 2017, shortly after being named The Best Restaurant in the World, Eleven Madison Park closed for a facelift. It reopened with a clean, updated aesthetic marked by cobalt blue mohair banquettes, terrazzo tiling, and a blue painting by artist Rita Ackermann that presides over the dining room. The team also expanded the bar area to make room for additional lounge tables. On the plate: When Eleven Madison Park reopened post renovation, chef Daniel Humm’s plating took on a more minimalist, almost Nordic aesthetic. His iconic lavender and honey roast duck morphed into a honey glazed duck with apple and rutabaga, and he introduced what has become an instant hit: a savoury cheesecake made from smoked sturgeon, anointed with a mountain of caviar. Keep it quick: For those looking to experience a shorter meal, the bar offers an abbreviated five-course tasting menu, as compared to the dining room’s eight to 10 plates. About the chef: Swiss-born chef Humm started working in kitchens at age 14, and earned his first Michelin star at 24. He became executive chef at Eleven Madison Park in 2006 when the restaurant was owned by Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group. In 2011, he became co-owner with the charismatic Will Guidara, who runs the front of house. Other projects: Under Humm and Guidara

What to expect: This is unashamedly a fine-dining restaurant, complete with white tablecloths and luxurious velvet banquettes, but it’s also very much a contemporary version. The colour palette is light, the décor elegant – much like Royer’s ultra-refined take on modern French food using ingredients carefully sourced from a global list of artisanal producers. Dishes to savour: Hokkaido Uni combines sea urchin, langoustine tartare, Granny Smith apple and caviar to stunning effect; Royer’s morels with veal sweetbreads and fresh asparagus has French terroir in spades; while rosemary-smoked organic egg is another signature. What about the team: General Manager Steven Mason, formerly of The Ledbury in London, and star sommelier Vincent Tan join Royer to make a formidable force: relaxed and personable, but highly skilled and decidedly ambitious. New era: Now that Restaurant André has shuttered, Odette has taken over as The Best Restaurant in Singapore in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants, and flies the flag for the Lion City on The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list.
Originality and technique at historic Paris restaurant What makes it so special? One of Paris's oldest and most prestigious restaurants, Pavillon Ledoyen was given a new lease of life when Yannick Alléno took the helm in 2014 and introduced boundary-pushing modern French cuisine. The restaurant was last year’s Highest New Entry, sponsored by Aspire Lifestyles, debuting at No.31.Typical dishes: Alléno's originality, technique and obsession with flavour are evident in hot sea urchin soup, served in a burned grapefruit shell and accompanied by crispy duck skin topped with foie gras, plus iodized granita. It's followed by a celebration of milk-fed lamb comprising leg tartare with quince and black truffle, saddle with pickles, and cutlet and collar with a sage fritter.Some background: Legend has it that Napoleon met Josephine at the Ledoyen, which which first opened in 1791. Other regulars included Robespierre, Degas and Zola.About the chef: Alléno learned his craft under some of France's greatest chefs, including Gabriel Biscay, Roland Durand

“Scottish chef guides you through the menu over an auditoryisery of vegetables, fish and sea meat. Who’s at the stove: Scottish chef Isaac McHale is at the helm of The Ledbury, a 16-course culinary tasting menu centred on the finest produce of Scotland’s most talented chefs. The restaurant, situated atop a hill in Fife, is home to a stout Carmelite bar and island club. André Gaultier, the brother who helped found the movement, is at the helm with Daniel Dale Ayrton’s new venture aiming to make Fife’s cooking magic a reality. A few words on the food: There’s no denying that Ayrton’s cooking is unique and, at 65, is well equipped in many regards, such as his Wine Spectator tour de force. But what of the food? Dip a fork into the menu on any given day and you’ll quickly discover that the food more than holds its own. Turbot is paired with Brussels sprouts, bacon and a sauce of mushrooms from Paris. The texture of new-season white asparagus is played off against oysters, hazelnuts and clotted cream.

Highlights include: 1.Grocery grade crackers with cactus, olives and aura beans; 2.Grocery grade taco bites with cactus, olives and aura beans; and a dessert infused with Etxebarri's favourite ingredient: cacio, an aromatic root previously used in the cosmetics industry.What’s the vibe? Housed in a monolithic glass cube in Vienna’s Stadtpark, Steirereck’s design may be super-modern but the interior speaks a recognisable language of international fine dining. It’s a bright, tranquil vision of wood, concrete and starched white table linen.Typical dishes: Reitbauer’s signature says everything you need to know about his outlook, being equal parts culinary theatre, precise technique and obvious reverence of local ingredients. The freshwater mountain fish, char, is cooked at the table in hot beeswax before being returned on a plate with yellow carrot, pollen and sour cream.What else? While the tasting menu is, undoubtedly, the best way to engage with Reitbauer’s vision, the à la carte menu also includes plenty of gems – from a wild boar’s head with carrots, pineapple, radicchio and buckwheat to Forono beets with hempseed, new potatoes and woodruff.Portrait: Fotografin Kanizaj Marija
Spectacular views, creative cuisine and Russian talent A few words on the chef: Chef Vladimir Mukhin is in the vanguard of a new wave of young Russian culinary talents. Known as much for his use of local, seasonal ingredients as for his charisma, Mukhin is making international waves and appeared in the 2017 series of Netflix’s Chef’s Table.Typical dishes: Traditional Russian produce like borodinsky black bread marries luxe ingredients like caviar to create innovative dishes. Standouts include rabbit and mini cabbage rolls in foie gras with potato crisps and truffle juice as well as roast suckling pig and Black Sea oysters.Down the rabbit hole: As the name may suggest, the restaurant whimsically embraces an Alice In Wonderland theme – think lots of rabbits and rococo furniture… so be sure not to be late for your

Minimalist grill cookery using premiere Basque ingredients What makes it special: Chef Victor Arguinzoniz has a remarkable ability to coax out explosive flavour from seemingly simple ingredients, most of which are grilled over an open hearth. What’s on the menu: Arguinzoniz respects the intrinsic natural flavours of premiere local products and delicately urges each ingredient to show its potential: goat’s milk churned into ethereal butter, green peas amplified in their own juice, beef dry aged for so many days it burns with umami. Arguinzoniz cooks vegetables and proteins – including ice cream – on a range of charcoals he makes from a variety of woods, kissing most plates with at least a suggestion of smoke. About the chef: Arguinzoniz was born and raised in the farming community of Axpe, a tiny picturesque village nestled in the mountains an hour’s drive from Bilbao. He is self-taught and has only worked in one kitchen – his own – where he designed and built his famous adjustable-heat grills. A lack of pretense: Despite its world-renowned status, what separates Etxebarri from many other world-class restaurants is its simple – boarding on austere – second-floor, stone-adorned dining room that’s totally unpretentious. Eccentric maître d’ and sommelier Agustí Peris presides over the front-of-house operations,

Japanese chef Takeshi ‘Goh’ Fukuyama began his career at age 18 in the kitchen of a ryotei (exclusive traditional Japanese restaurant) in Tokyo’s Kagurazaka geisha area, where his mother worked. Eleven years later he opened Den, which moved to its current location in late 2016. The philosophy: Rather than sticking to the elegant, refined but often impersonal traditions of high-end kaiseki cuisine, Hasegawa offers an elevated, deeply personal take on Japanese home cooking. He draws on diverse influences, both home-grown and gleaned on overseas trips, but always based around prime ingredients from ocean, pasture and forest. Any house-specials? So many, and most of them changing with the seasons. But constant points of reference include the signature foie gras monaka (wafer sandwich) as an appetiser; the 20-plus-vegetable Den garden salad, invariably incorporating a few surprises; and the now-classic Dentucky Fried Chicken – probably the best chicken wings you will ever taste, complete with customised fast-food take-out carton. Underpinning everything, the culmination of every meal is the donabe-gohan, claypot-cooked rice with wagyu beef or seafood. Read all about it: There’s now a cookbook, simply and appropriately titled “Den: The Evolving Tokyo Japanese Cuisine.” Although mostly in Japanese, it has some English text and enough sumptuous images to give a good taste of what makes Hasegawa’s cooking so special. Service from the heart: Hasegawa likes to say his aim is to see his customers leaving with smiles on their faces. An essential ingredient in achieving this is the welcome and service provided by Den’s front-of-house team, which was recognised in 2017 with the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants inaugural Art of Hospitality Award.Portrait: Andrea Fazzari

’s chef Rasmus Kofoed is currently working with the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú to found the country’s first gastronomic university. Kofoed is also the only chef to have ever won the gold, silver and bronze medals at the esteemed global cooking competition the Bocuse d’Or, and his meticulous approach to seasonal Danish cuisine has seen Geranium climb its way up The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list from No.49 in 2012 to No.19 this year. How to find it: The rather unexpected locale of a national soccer stadium serves as Geranium’s backdrop. The restaurant is located on the facility’s eighth floor, and its dining room affords panoramic views of Fælledparken (Common Gardens). Ask management to tour the rear kitchen area for a look at the most epic of sports stadium field views. Fun fact: While Kofoed heads up kitchen operations, partner Søren Ledet manages the dining room and wine. But when Geranium opened in 2007, those roles were yet to be defined. Since both men counted chef backgrounds, they initially planned to each spend time cooking and running the front-of-house. But Kofoed quickly found himself romanced by the kitchen, while Ledet fell in love with hospitality and booze––landing them in the positions they command today. Over the years, Ledet’s 2,500-bottle wine list, which spans from classic selections to natural-leaning juice, has won numerous accolades, including Wine Spectator’s prestigious Grand Award. This year, his dedication to exceptional service wins Geranium The Ferrari Trento Art of Hospitality Award.Images: Claes Bech-Poulsen Edible art: The seemingly unlikely duo of nature and technology are at the heart of chef Rasmus Kofoed’s progressive tasting menu: 17-plus inspired, artistic courses composed of organic and wild Scandinavian ingredients.

Diners are eventually seated in a section of the dining room, flanked by temporary fabric walls projecting different scenes for different courses.The chef: Enrique Olvera, who fell in love with fine dining after visiting Jardin des Sens at the age of 20. He took over the then-empty castle in Chios in 1994, when he was only 26 years old, to realise his vision of an all-around hospitality experience for his guests. Starting with a team of only four employees, Olvera has grown and developed the restaurant with relentless passion, now running a team of 40 and with three Michelin stars to his name.

A new breed of formidable hillbilly chefs reignites the plates in a charmingly appointed dining room. It also just happens to deliver one of the very finest dining experiences in the world, combining nods to tradition with fierce modernity, philosophical conceptions with old-fashioned flavour, warmth with daring. It could have been different: In its early days, the restaurant almost closed after conservative locals were resistant to Bottura’s tradition-busting approach to the Italian kitchen. Thankfully, the locally born chef and his American wife Lara Gilmore persevered. Now, of course, Bottura is feted by fellow chefs, critics and diners both closer to home and from across the globe. On the menu: Bottura weaves a range of narratives through his dishes, playing with ingredients from the surrounding Emilia-Romagna region.

Aside from Mikla, he is also chef and partner at 18 restaurants and cafes including the Numnum casual restaurant chain, Italian eatery Trattoria Enzo and the Kronotrop coffee bar and roastery. What’s on the menu: Gürs is a champion of the New Anatolian Kitchen, where he transforms traditional and ‘noble’ products with a blend of new and ancient techniques. His menu includes everything from Anatolian raw milk cheeses to north Aegean octopus and Iskenderun prawns with 65-degrees egg. What about a nightcap? A meal at Mikla is not complete without a trip to the top of the Marmara Pera hotel to sample one of the cocktails at the rooftop bar. Not only is the unmissable 360 views of Istanbul, there’s also a DJ playing mellow tunes and a lively crowd of locals and international gastronomes.Images: Mecit Gülaydin, Karos
An ingenious British culinary history lesson from Ashley Palmer-Watts What to expect: It may be a large, extremely busy hotel restaurant in the posher part of west London, but don’t underestimate the ingenuity and originality of the dishes at Dinner, which retain the Blumenthal stamp, albeit in a very different guise to those at The Fat Duck. What’s more, dishes are delivered by super-friendly and well-versed staff. History lesson: The menu was conceived following extensive research into historical British dishes from as far back as the 14th Century, and has retained that unique niche since its opening. But while some creations have become world-famous – Meat Fruit, Rice & Flesh et al – there are lower-profile gems to look out for such as Frumenty (grilled octopus, spelt, smoked sea broth, pickled dulse and lovage, circa 1390) and Eggs in Verjuice (verbena and coconut panna cotta, coffee parfait, verjuice and citrus, circa 1730). Will Heston be there? Not usually. The restaurant is led by chef-director Ashley Palmer-Watts, who has been with Blumenthal for almost two decades. At Dinner, which

The Chef’s Award won by Dan Barber is the most prestigious restaurant merit in modern French cooking, claiming it’s forlo in 2015 with a prestigious chef’s award at The World’s 50 Best Restaurants. However, Barber has serious pedigree, having co-founded several restaurants with fellow chef Vincent Tan in New York, including his casual beer and burger chain Meatlicious, the Sühring twins’ eponymous German restaurant, new tofu omakase restaurant Mihara Tofuten, and Gaa and Wet, both ventures from Gaggan alumni.Images: fb://allwecandid
A showcase of colour and diversity from all over Peru What makes it special: Chefs Virgilio Martínez and Pía León’s flagship restaurant is a shrine to everything that is Peruvian, including many ingredients that are seldom served elsewhere. The husband-and-wife team have been travelling the length and breadth of the country for several years to source interesting and unique produce from land, sea and mountains. On the menu: Martínez and León like to play with the many varieties of corn, potato and much more obscure products offered by Peru’s vastly biodiverse landscape. Classics include Land of Corn and Extreme Stems, with newer dishes such as Waters of Nanay featuring piranha fish served in an entire, sharp-tooth-filled piranha head. The menu explores every altitude, from 20 metres below sea level to 4,100 metres above it, in 17+ courses. Central family: Martínez and León got married four days after the awards ceremony for The World’s 50 Best Restaurants in 2013, where they celebrated Central’s first appearance on the list. León runs the kitchen day-to-day while Martínez still oversees the menu. The couple run together, work together and travel together, often in search of new ingredients with Martínez’s sister, Malena. Other ventures: Central has left its original location in Lima’s Miraflores district for a new home in the arty Barranco neighbourhood, where Malena Martínez will run their Mater Iniciativa research project from a larger base. León opens her first solo restaurant, named Kjolle, at the end of July 2018 in the same spot. Earlier in 2018, the

Japanese cuisine from the world’s No.1 chef What makes it special: Consistently ranked as The Best Restaurant in Australasia, Attica is the brainchild of chef Ben Shewry, originally hailing from New Zealand. In a discreet spot in Melbourne’s Ripponlea neighbourhood, he serves up an elaborate menu of fresh Australian produce in a cosy dining room and vegetable garden. What’s on the menu? A meal at Attica takes diners through a series of dishes and ingredients that are unfamiliar to many Australians, let alone international gastronomes. Rather than foie gras, caviar or lobster, the chef serves his own version of luxury, including pearl cooked in paperbark, hand-picked crab with wattle bread, grilled marron with desert lime and even bunya bunya (Shewry’s favourite ingredient). Each course has its own colourful name, such as Our Vegemite, Our Salada, Tac’Oz and Pests of the Neighbourhood. Some highlights: Among many other must-eat dishes on the menu is the whipped emu egg, served instead a large, open emu eggshell. Red kangaroo is another mainstay and the marron, similar to crayfish, is unmissable.Images: Colin Page What makes it special: Consistently ranked as The Best Restaurant in Australasia, Attica is the brainchild of chef Ben Shewry, originally hailing from New Zealand.

Innovative cuisine in stunning surrounds with sustainability at the heart Unique selling point: Far from the straightforward sit-down restaurant experience, at Azurmendi the journey starts in the rooftop vegetable garden where guests inspect the home-grown produce before continuing via the kitchen to an indoor greenhouse for a selection of ‘snacks’. Diners are eventually seated in a section of the dining room, flanked by temporary fabric walls projecting different scenes for different courses.The chef: Basque cook Eneko Atxa was brought up with the kitchen at the heart of his home and says he’s committed to giving guests the same homely experience. Azurmendi is a family business that also houses a winery run by his cousin, Bertol Izagirre, specialising in Basque txakoli wine.Other ventures: The chef opened Eneko at One Aldwych, a more relaxed version of Azurmendi, in London in 2016.On the menu: Highlights include Truffled egg, which is ‘cooked inside out’, with part of the yolk removed and replaced with truffle consommé, while Edible Cotton is a classic snack that guests eat in the greenhouse.Bonus point: Azurmendi first won The Sustainable Restaurant Award in 2014, and this year it once again gained the highest sustainbility rating, winning the award for a second time. Not only is the restaurant made with environmentally friendly materials, it also recycles its own waste, harvests rainfall and cools itself using geothermal energy.

all About: When Peru meets Japan on the plate, Nikkei is born – and chef Mitsuharu ‘Micha’ Tsumura is the Nikkei king. This translates to a welcoming spot where fresh fish and citrus-packed sauces reign supreme. No wonder it was voted The Best Restaurant in Latin America in 2017, knocking nearby Central from its three-year stint at No.1. On the menu: Chef Micha’s Nikkei Experience menu is a journey through Peruvian-Japanese fusion cuisine, with an emphasis on seafood. There is succulent cod marinated in miso with crispy nuts, nigiri sushi, sea urchin rice, 50-hour beef short rib and even tofu cheesecake ice cream. Everything sings with flavour, zing and the natural bright colours that come from Peru’s produce. There’s also a separate sushi counter and menu for everyday or business diners. About the chef: Born in Lima, Tsumura was encouraged by his father to turn his passion for cooking into a profession and, after studying culinary arts in the US, he went to Japan to learn about his cultural and culinary heritage. He spent many months washing dishes before learning vital knife skills and eventually how to cook rice and make sushi. He took a job at the Sheraton on returning to Lima and, some years later, opened Maido. Other ventures: Tsumura has his hand in many pies, including the casual Sushi Pop chain and Karai restaurant in Santiago. He recently opened Ají restaurant in Macao, serving many of the Maido classics alongside flavoursome fish tiraditos and nigiri.Images: José Cáceres All about Nikkei: When Peru meets Japan on the plate, Nikkei is born – and chef Mitsuharu ‘Micha’ Tsumura is the Nikkei king.

Did you know that Napoleon met Josephine at the Sheraton on their first cruise together, having met at the Zen master classes at the age of 20. In print: Signature dishes include the elegant Sushi Momofuku (Shewry-led, squid-led, squid-focused crab carnival), the elegant Maid of Crust (ant eggs), and the elegant Nihonryori Kagawa (ant eggs, mozzarella, and fresh dumplings). Will Hasegawa see some action in the history books? Not usually. The restaurant is led by chef-director Ashley Palmer-Watts, who has been with Blumenthal for almost two decades. At Dinner, which now includes a branch in Melbourne with another to come in Dubai in 2019, Palmer-Watts has established himself as an innovator in his own right. Worth noting: The glass-walled kitchen allows diners to see a pineapple slowly roasting to on an elevated spit, the centrepiece of the famed (and delicious) Tipsy Cake dessert.Portrait: Karon Photography / Dishes: John Blackwell What to expect: It may be a large, extremely busy hotel restaurant in the posher part of west London, but don’t underestimate the ingenuity and originality of the dishes at Dinner, which retain the Blumenthal stamp, albeit in a very different guise to those at The Fat Duck.

Popular starters include his remarkable chicken foot, with chicken liver and fermented lingonberry juice, decorated with glistening red sorrel leaves. Theatrical dining: The kitchen is located on the mezzanine level and dinner is punctuated by the procession of waiters, and often chefs, too, carrying dishes down the gracefully curving stairs to the dining room. The best seats in the house are at the upstairs six-seat chef’s table, which faces directly in (through glass) to the intense activity in the kitchen.
A colourful, emoji-led feast from Asia’s unstoppable chef Best Restaurant in Asia: For the last four years in a row, Gaggan has been voted No.1 in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants, testament to the constant innovation and improvement at this ever-evolving hub of creativity. El Bulli-influenced chef Gaggan Anand serves up a menu of 25 or more courses of rapid-fire small bites, many of which are eaten with the hands. Visit while you can: While Gaggan is currently the best that Asia has to offer, it won’t be for much longer, as Anand has pledged to close his flagship restaurant in 2020 after 10 years serving gastronomes from all over the globe. After the final service, he plans to open a small restaurant in Fukuoka, Japan, with fellow Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants chef Takeshi ‘Goh’ Fukuyama of La Maison de la Nature Goh. Constant creativity: With the help of a test kitchen and some shiny new equipment, Anand’s menu has evolved from purely modern Indian to a much more global cuisine as the chef has travelled and taken influence from restaurants all over the world. The menu now includes Mexican-inspired taco bites, Japanese-Indian nigiri sushi and even aubergine Oreo biscuits. The classic Yoghurt Explosion remains on the menu alongside newer signatures such as Lick It Up, where diners are encouraged to lick a flavoursome curry straight from the plate. Other ventures: Kolkata-born chef Anand has invested in multiple other restaurants in his adopted Bangkok over the last few years, including his casual beer and burger chain Meatlicious, the Sühring twins’ eponymous German restaurant, new tofu omakase restaurant Mihara Tofuten, and Gaa and Wet, both

André ter Stegen is a geisha pastry chef from Steirereck, New South Wales, Australia. He took over the then-empty castle in Fürstenau in 2003, when he was only 26 years old, to realise his vision of an all-around hospitality experience for his guests. Starting with a team of only four employees, Ter Stegen has grown and developed the restaurant with relentless passion, now running a team of 40 and with three Michelin stars to his name. The experience: With equal importance given to food and hospitality, a dinner at Schloss Schauenstein is a warm and immersive experience from the moment you are greeted by the attentive staff at the door. The menu is designed to enrich the senses, with dishes such as beef, apple and mustard, or Swiss pikeperch fish, artichoke and mushrooms. Bonus point: Caminada, the name implies, translates as “Fish” in German, which translates as “Fish” in Spanish. Ter Stegen is located near Here, Achathe, and while he is not a official Michelin winner, he is likely to be one of the first chefs to say that.Portrait: Fotografin Kanizaj Marija

Rebecca Palmer slowly builds a presence in the restaurant’s mid-century cabin, where her mother worked. During the 70s, when Scotland was still a relatively small island nation, Scotland had become a global phenomenon. Presented with a backdrop of seemingly simple ingredients, where vegetables, fish and cereals ply their trade, he encourages innovation and creativity in all of the staff. How does it play out? A meal takes place over 20 courses – several of them, if the weather is clement, served in the gorgeously appointed gardens around the restaurant. Basque cuisine often combines elements of the mountains and the sea, and so it is at Mugaritz where the menu might roam from lettuce hearts with chorizo and house-cured salmon bonbon, via aged mole leaves and bone marrow presented in a book, to tigernut ice cream with fresh fried rice. What’s the vibe: One of the greatest things about Mugaritz is the sense of play, whether it’s the waiters throwing a curve-ball for the wine lovers at the table with a mystery bottle (a well-aged rosé from Lebanon’s Chateau Musar, perhaps), or the presentation of chocolate petit fours in stacked oak boxes designed to allude to the seven deadly sins. Bonus point: In summer 2017, Mugaritz is hosting the first-ever winner of a 50 Best BBVA Scholaship, aspiring Taiwanese chef Jessie Liu.Portrait: Alex Iturralde; images: Jose Luis López de Zubiria
Minimalist grill cookery using premiere Basque ingredients What makes it special: Chef Victor Arguinzoniz has a remarkable ability to coax out explosive flavour from seemingly simple ingredients, most of which are grilled over an open hearth. What’s on the menu: Arguinzoniz respects the intrinsic natural flavours of premiere local products and delicately urges each ingredient to show its potential: goat’s milk churned into ethereal butter, green peas amplified in their own juice, beef dry aged for so many days it burns with umami. Arguinzoniz cooks vegetables and proteins – including ice cream – on a range of charcoals he makes from a variety of woods, kissing most plates with at least a suggestion of smoke. About the chef: Arguinzoniz was born and raised in the farming community of

Modern French onion rings – and the chef may well have been the only woman in the restaurant, if that doesn’t sum up his outlook.   A modern classic Who’s behind it: The brilliant and mercurial chef talent of Joshua Skenes was on full display during the course of giving a talk titled “How to make an exquisite wine pair'. Named after the restaurant’s masterful grill cookery, he uses innovative techniques to fine-tune his dishes, often turning out exquisite dishes from his basement kitchen. The wine, on the other hand, is ahistorical, showcasing images of before and since the restaurant’s heyday in the 17th century. What’s more, dishes are held in the restaurant’s bowels during times of famine or disease. The chef: Known as Muchacho when he returned from the US to open his first restaurant in 1996, Francisco Cáceres also left a powerful mark on the restaurant. Having apprenticed under Michel Bras in his native Spain, Cáceres worked in the Caribbean and London before arriving in New York in 1986. He established himself as the region’s rising star while at Jaan, before opening Odette in 1993 at the grand National Gallery Singapore. What to expect: This is unashamedly a fine-dining restaurant, complete with white tablecloths and luxurious velvet banquettes, but it’s also very much a contemporary version. The colour palette is light, the décor elegant – much like the menu – which may or may not include fish or saffron. The husband-and-wife team have been travelling the length and breadth of the country for several years to source interesting and unique produce from land, sea and mountains. On the menu: The nightly changing tasting menu of up to 18 courses not only showcases the highest-quality produce but is guided by what is best on that very day. Dishes may feature Skenes’s Liquid Toast, a glazed sea urchin served on crusty bread soaked in a rich sauce of grilled bread and dusted with a powder of river vegetables; or barbecued celeriac slow-cooked in the fireplace for three days. Chefs step out from the barrier-free kitchen into the dining room to explain each dish. Bonus point: Skenes is shortly to open his own hideaway ranch up in the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state

The menu explores every altitude, from 20 metres below sea level to 4,100 metres above it, in 17+ courses.

One of France’s most iconic chefs honours “naturalness” in an opulent dining room Clean cuisine: As one of the most legendary leaders in classic French haute cuisine, in 2014 Alain Ducasse overhauled his landmark fine dining destination in the luxe Parisian hotel of the same name. His new approach – one that propelled the restaurant back onto The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2017 after falling off the list in 2016 – prioritises sustainability, health and wellness-hinged plates focused on vegetables, fish and cereals. The room: In one of the world’s most plush and luxurious dining rooms, guests enjoy elegant vegetable- and sea-focused tasting menus under a giant glittering chandelier cascading with Swarovski crystals. Pod-esque curved benches are sheathed in glossy steel, deriving their inspiration from domes used to cover plates. A tall oak alcove wraps around a single table, “Table Cabane,” providing extra privacy, bearing an interior relief design pattered to look like a mushroom.

One of the most iconic dishes from the French Riviera, Etxebarri has become a cult destination following the release of their first-ever Michelin Guide. Led by chef and owner-chef Julien Royer, Etxebarri has become the go-to spot for everything from classic to contemporary. Who’s at the stove: Enter the surprising pair of chefs, chef Daniela (Llama) and masterful chef Daniel Riviera (The Grand Piazza). What to expect: This is unashamedly a fine-dining restaurant, complete with white tablecloths and luxurious velvet banquettes, but it’s also very much a contemporary version. The colour palette is light, the décor elegant – much like Royer’s ultra-refined take on modern French food using ingredients carefully sourced from a global list of artisanal producers. Dishes to savour: Hokkaido Uni combines sea urchin, langoustine tartare, Granny Smith apple and caviar to stunning effect; Royer’s morels with veal sweetbreads and fresh asparagus has French terroir in spades; while rosemary-smoked organic egg is another signature. What about the team: General Manager Steven Mason, formerly of The Ledbury in London, and star sommelier Vincent Tan join Royer to make a formidable force: relaxed and personable, but highly skilled and decidedly ambitious. New era: Now that Restaurant André has shuttered, Odette has taken over as The Best Restaurant in Singapore in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants, and flies the flag for the Lion City on The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list.

Tableau, a New York-based experimental sushi restaurant, is located in medias around the world and has drawn visitors to Japan and South Korea alike. About the chef: Yoshihiro Narisawa left home at 19 and spent eight years cutting his teeth in some of Europe’s most venerated kitchens, including those of Paul Bocuse and Joël Robuchon. In 1996, he returned home to Japan and opened La Napoule in Kanagawa Prefecture. Seven years later, he moved to his current space in Tokyo’s non-touristy district of Minami Aoyama and formed Les Créations de Narisawa. After eight years of service, he renamed the restaurant simply Narisawa. What’s on the plate: Narisawa defines his food as “innovative Satoyama,” the word “Satoyama” representing a border zone between mountain foothills and flat land where people live sustainably with nature. Narisawa expresses this culture of respecting the earth through an elaborate omakase. Diners fall under the spell of the season, and sample fleeting flavours from provinces around the country. Depending on the season, some might try a broth made from a poisonous snake that resides in the waters near Okinawa, or a warm sashimi course of langoustine from Suruga Bay.  To drink: Narisawa is one of the best places in the world to appreciate the finest of Japanese winemaking, with Pinot Noir from Nagano, Riesling from Iwate and aged Bordeaux-style blends from Yamagata. Of course there’s sake, too.  On the road: In 2017, Narisawa teamed up with celebrated Brazilian food photographer Sergio Coimbra on an exhibit titled Satoyama, which debuted in São Paulo, featuring photos of the chef’s nature-inspired plates. Most recently, the show jumped seas to Los Angeles, where Narisawa and Coimbra’s collective work was on display during the month of May. Images: Sergio Coimbra

“Japanese cuisine with quality, creativity and a warm welcome (plus an ant or two) Who’s in the kitchen? Chef Zaiyu Hasegawa began his career at age 18 in the kitchen of a ryotei (exclusive traditional Japanese restaurant) in Tokyo’s Kagurazaka geisha area, where his mother worked. Eleven years later he opened Den, which moved to its current location in late 2016. The philosophy: Rather than sticking to the elegant, refined but often impersonal traditions of high-end kaiseki cuisine, Hasegawa offers an elevated, deeply personal take on Japanese home cooking. He draws on diverse influences, both home-grown and gleaned on overseas trips, but always based around prime ingredients from ocean, pasture and forest. Any house-specials? So many, and most of them changing with the seasons. But constant points of reference include the signature foie gras monaka (wafer sandwich) as an appetiser; the 20-plus-vegetable Den garden salad, invariably incorporating a few surprises; and the now-classic Dentucky Fried Chicken – probably the best chicken wings you will ever taste, complete with customised fast-food take-out carton. Underpinning everything, the culmination of every meal is the donabe-gohan, claypot-cooked rice with wagyu beef or seafood. Read all about it: There’s now a cookbook, simply and appropriately titled “Den: The Evolving Tokyo Japanese Cuisine.” Although mostly in Japanese, it has some English text and enough sumptuous images to give a good taste of what makes Hasegawa’s cooking so special. Service from the heart: Hasegawa likes to say his aim is to see his customers leaving with smiles on their faces. An essential ingredient in achieving this is the welcome and service provided by Den’s front-of-house team, which was recognised in 2017 with the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants inaugural Art of Hospitality Award.Portrait: Andrea Fazzari Who’s in the kitchen?

Alinea’s omakase predicament is exposed during the dining room’s busiest hours, allowing diners to see a young woman carrying out complex dishes that’s elevated in the dining room’s shadows.

The dish: Founded by Peru’s indigenous people, Miele is committed to deriving the greatest flavour potential from every animal and botanical on the land and devoted to producing food with a low environmental impact. On the menu: The menu now includes everything from black truffle dim sum to mango chicken satay and pomelo with coconut and butterhead lettuce. How many endemic Chilean species will I eat? Nine years into Miele’s understanding and timing with respect to when products flourish in particular micro seasons – and how to use them – is greater than ever.

One of the greatest things about Mugaritz is the sense of play, whether it’s the waiters throwing a curve-ball for the wine lovers at the table with a mystery bottle (a well-aged rosé from Lebanon’s Chateau Musar, perhaps), or the presentation of chocolate petit fours in stacked oak boxes designed to allude to the seven deadly sins. Bonus point: In summer 2018, Mugaritz is hosting the first-ever winner of a 50 Best BBVA Scholaship, aspiring Taiwanese chef Jessie Liu.Portrait: Alex Iturralde; images: Jose Luis López de Zubiria Creative mind: Andoni Luis Aduriz, simply known as Andoni, is considered by many observers to be the natural heir to the title of Spain’s most pioneering chef after Ferran Adrià. Treating Mugaritz as a research lab, he encourages innovation and creativity in all of his staff. How does it play out? A meal takes place over 20 courses – several of them, if the weather is clement, served in the gorgeously appointed gardens around the restaurant. Basque cuisine often combines elements of the mountains and the sea, and so it is at Mugaritz where the menu might roam from lettuce hearts with chorizo and house-cured salmon bonbon, via aged mole leaves and bone marrow presented in a book, to tigernut ice cream with fresh fried rice.

In 2005, Juan Mari Gutsche left for a stint at René Redzepi’s Noma in Copenhagen and opened Quintonil with his wife Alejandra Flores in 2012. Flores and her charismatic team run the front-of-house at Quintonil. Urban garden: Much of the produce at Quintonil comes from a nearby garden, where the cooks pick fresh veg and greens on a daily basis. Vallejo and his team keep their carbon footprint so low that many of their ingredients travel just 30 metres from origin to plate.
Rustic farmhouse serving a progressive and sustainably-minded tasting menu What makes it special: Approximately 30 miles north of Manhattan, chef Dan Barber’s ambitious farmstead restaurant Blue Hill at Stone Barns, set within an enchanting barn on an 80-acre estate shared with non-profit educational space Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture, builds a beautiful 30-course tasting menu centred on produce that is often pulled from the earth mere hours before hitting a plate. Barber is committed to deriving the greatest flavour potential from every animal and botanical on the land and devoted to producing food with a low environmental impact. On the menu: Barber consistently seeks out eco-friendly and low-waste practices to enhances his menus. For example, he cooks vegetables in the heat created by vegetative compost. And just recently, his kitchen stripped and cut the brawny stems from overwintered fighter spinach into a cacio e pepe dish that looks just like green-hued penne pasta. Redesigning food: For years Barber has worked with seed breeders at the genetic level to develop more nutritious fruit and vegetables with deeper flavour. In 2018, he and several long-time seed breeder associates launched Row 7, an operation that sells seeds for plants like Badger Flame Beets and Habanada Peppers designed to taste better, yield more, and resist disease. Going casual: For those looking to sample Barber’s cuisine without signing up for a four-hour tasting menu, Stone Barns also houses a more casual café open Wednesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Here, diners can find seasonal pastries and more substantial options like roasted chicken.Award winner: In 2018, Dan Barber was voted by his peers of The World's 50 Best Restaurants list as the winner of the Chefs' Choice Award.Images:
